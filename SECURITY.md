# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues via one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/dcyfr/dcyfr-labs/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

2. **Direct Contact**
   - Email: [Contact via website form](https://www.dcyfr.ai/contact)
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide as much detail as possible

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., XSS, CSRF, injection, authentication bypass)
- **Location** (file path, URL, or affected component)
- **Steps to reproduce** (detailed, step-by-step instructions)
- **Impact assessment** (what an attacker could potentially do)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** (for follow-up questions)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline:** Depends on severity (see below)

## 🛡️ Security Measures

This project implements comprehensive security controls:

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

- ✅ Nonce-based CSP (Level 2+) with unique cryptographic nonces per request
- ✅ Violation reporting to `/api/csp-report` endpoint
- ✅ Automatic development environment relaxations
- ✅ Fallback CSP in production configuration

### Rate Limiting

- ✅ Redis-backed distributed rate limiting
- ✅ Per-endpoint limits:
  - Contact form: 3 requests/60s per IP
  - GitHub endpoints: 10 requests/60s per IP
  - CSP reports: 30 requests/60s per IP
- ✅ Graceful fallback to in-memory limiting

### Data Protection

- ✅ PII anonymization (email domains only in logs)
- ✅ Message content never logged
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement with HSTS headers
- ✅ Secure environment variable handling

- ✅ PI (Proprietary Information) protection — Treat proprietary information similarly to PII in terms of storage, logging, and access control. See NIST's definition: https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/proprietary_information
- ✅ See `docs/security/.private/pi-policy.md` for a full policy and handling checklist for PI/PII and private drafts.

### Input Validation

- ✅ All API endpoints validate inputs
- ✅ XSS protection via React's built-in escaping
- ✅ CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- ✅ Anti-spam measures (honeypot fields)

### Infrastructure Security

- ✅ Security headers (A+ rating)
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- ✅ Dependency scanning (npm audit + Dependabot)
- ✅ Code security scanning (GitHub CodeQL)
- ✅ Automated security updates via Dependabot

### Deployment Integrity & Verified Commits

- ✅ Protected deployment branches are expected to require **GitHub-verified commits** before merge
- ✅ Accepted signature methods: **GPG** (preferred), **SSH signing**, **S/MIME**
- ✅ Pull requests targeting `main` or `preview` are validated by the `Verified Commits` workflow
- ✅ Vercel Verified Commits is the intended deployment-layer backstop for protected branches

Operational guidance:

- Contributors must publish their signing identity to GitHub before using protected branches.
- Rotated or expired keys should be refreshed immediately and commits re-signed as needed.
- Emergency bypasses for deployment protections must be explicit, time-bound, and audited.

### Monitoring & Error Tracking

- ✅ Sentry integration for error monitoring
- ✅ Vercel analytics for performance tracking
- ✅ CSP violation monitoring
- ✅ Rate limit violation logging

## 📋 Vulnerability Severity Levels

| Severity     | Description                                               | Response Time | Example                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, authentication bypass, data breach | 24 hours      | SQL injection, auth bypass        |
| **High**     | Privilege escalation, XSS, sensitive data exposure        | 3-5 days      | Stored XSS, broken access control |
| **Medium**   | CSRF, information disclosure, security misconfiguration   | 7-14 days     | CSRF on non-critical endpoints    |
| **Low**      | Minor security issues with limited impact                 | 30 days       | Verbose error messages            |

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Scanning

We continuously monitor security through:

- **Dependency Scanning:** Dependabot (daily) + npm audit
- **Code Security:** GitHub CodeQL (on push, PR, and daily schedule)
- **Secret Scanning:** GitHub Secret Scanning

### PI/PII Scanning

- Local pre-commit scanning: run `npm run scan:pi` locally to scan staged files for likely PII or proprietary markers
- CI scanning: PRs are scanned using `.github/workflows/pii-scan.yml` and will fail if the checks detect likely sensitive content

- **Security Headers:** Automated header validation

### Manual Review

- Regular security audits of authentication flows
- CSP policy review and testing
- Rate limiting effectiveness testing
- Input validation boundary testing
