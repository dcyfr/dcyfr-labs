# Historical Implementation Sessions

This directory contains **historical session logs and implementation records** from the project's development. These files document the implementation process, decision-making, and problem-solving that occurred during specific development sessions.

## Purpose

Session archives provide:
- Historical context for feature implementations
- Records of architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Problem-solving approaches and solutions
- Learning resources for similar future implementations

## Usage

These documents are **read-only historical records**. When working on similar features:

1. **Review relevant session docs** to understand past approaches
2. **Learn from trade-offs** documented in decision-making
3. **Avoid repeating mistakes** by studying problem-solving approaches
4. **Don't copy-paste** - treat as learning resources, not templates

## Current Documentation

For active development, refer to:
- `/docs/components/` - Current component documentation
- `/docs/features/` - Active feature documentation
- `/docs/architecture/` - Current architecture patterns
- `/docs/operations/` - Current operations guides
