# Projects Archive Implementation

## Overview
Transformed the `/projects` page into an archive with individual project detail pages, reducing vertical spacing on project cards by removing the highlights section.

## Changes Made

### 1. ProjectCard Component (`src/components/project-card.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed expandable "Key Features" section (mobile and desktop)
- ✅ Removed `showHighlights` prop (no longer needed)
- ✅ Removed unused imports (`useState`, `ChevronDown`, `Button`, `CardContent`)
- ✅ Added primary "View Details" button linking to `/projects/[slug]`
- ✅ Simplified footer to show "View Details" first, then external links
- ✅ Updated JSDoc comments to reflect archive pattern

**Before:**
- Complex expandable highlights section
- Multiple state management for accordion
- Higher vertical footprint

**After:**
- Clean, minimal card design
- Single "View Details" CTA as primary action
- Reduced vertical spacing

### 2. Project Detail Page (`src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`)
**New file created** with:
- ✅ Full project information display
- ✅ Featured image (custom or default)
- ✅ Tech stack badges
- ✅ Category tags
- ✅ Complete highlights list in dedicated card
- ✅ Project links as prominent buttons
- ✅ "Other Projects" section showing 2 related projects
- ✅ Back to Projects link
- ✅ Full SEO metadata (OpenGraph, Twitter)
- ✅ JSON-LD structured data
- ✅ ISR with 1-hour revalidation
- ✅ Static generation via `generateStaticParams`

**Example URLs:**
- `/projects/cyberdrew-dev`
- `/projects/x64-indie-cyber-publication`
- `/projects/drews-lab` (when added)

### 3. Projects Archive Page (`src/app/projects/page.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated title: "Projects" → "Projects Archive"
- ✅ Enhanced description for better SEO
- ✅ Updated JSON-LD structured data
- ✅ Updated project URLs in schema from `#anchor` to `/projects/[slug]`

### 4. Project Card Skeleton (`src/components/project-card-skeleton.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed highlights section skeleton
- ✅ Simplified to match new card structure
- ✅ Updated spacing to match CardHeader
- ✅ Added primary "View Details" button skeleton
- ✅ Updated last synced date and comments

### 5. Sitemap (`src/app/sitemap.ts`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `visibleProjects` import
- ✅ Created `projectEntries` for all visible project detail pages
- ✅ Set priority to 0.6 and changeFrequency to "monthly"
- ✅ Included project entries in final sitemap return

## Benefits

### User Experience
1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Archive page shows essentials only
2. **Clear Navigation**: "View Details" as primary action
3. **Better Information Architecture**: Full details on dedicated pages
4. **Improved Mobile UX**: Less scrolling on archive, more focused cards

### Developer Experience
1. **Simpler Component**: Removed state management from ProjectCard
2. **Better Separation**: Archive view vs. detail view
3. **Consistent Pattern**: Matches blog structure (`/blog` → `/blog/[slug]`)
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Detail page is centralized, not in card

### SEO & Performance
1. **Individual URLs**: Each project gets its own URL for better indexing
2. **Structured Data**: Enhanced JSON-LD for project details
3. **Sitemap Coverage**: All projects included automatically
4. **Static Generation**: Pre-rendered at build time with ISR

## File Structure

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── projects/
│   │   ├── page.tsx            (Archive - Updated)
│   │   └── [slug]/
│   │       └── page.tsx        (Detail - NEW)
│   └── sitemap.ts              (Updated)
├── components/
│   ├── project-card.tsx         (Updated - Simplified)
│   └── project-card-skeleton.tsx (Updated)
└── data/
    └── projects.ts              (No changes)
```

## Design Patterns

### Archive Pattern
- Grid of simplified cards
- Quick scanning of all projects
- Prominent CTAs to detail pages

### Detail Pattern
- Comprehensive project information
- Visual hierarchy with featured image
- Organized sections (Tech Stack, Categories, Highlights)
- Navigation to related projects
- Breadcrumb back to archive

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Project Filtering**: Add filters for status, tech, tags on archive
2. **Project Search**: Search functionality on archive page
3. **Related Projects Algorithm**: Show projects with similar tech/tags
4. **Project Statistics**: Views, GitHub stats if available
5. **Project Timeline**: Visual timeline of project evolution
6. **MDX Content**: Support full MDX content files for complex projects

### Migration Path for Existing Projects
Current projects in `src/data/projects.ts` automatically work:
- Archive page shows all visible projects
- Detail pages auto-generated via `generateStaticParams`
- No data structure changes required

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Archive page renders all projects correctly
- [ ] "View Details" button navigates to correct slug
- [ ] Detail pages render for all visible projects
- [ ] 404 for invalid project slugs
- [ ] Back to Projects link works
- [ ] Other Projects section shows 2 projects (excluding current)
- [ ] SEO metadata correct on all pages
- [ ] Sitemap includes all project detail pages
- [ ] Mobile responsive on both archive and detail pages
- [ ] External links open in new tab with security attributes
- [ ] Images load with correct positioning

## Rollout Notes

### Breaking Changes
- **None** - Existing project data structure unchanged
- Archive URL remains `/projects`
- New detail URLs added at `/projects/[slug]`

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing project links continue to work
- Archive view automatically updates with new pattern
- No migration script needed

### Deployment
1. Changes are build-time only (no runtime dependencies)
2. Static generation ensures fast loading
3. ISR provides fresh content without full rebuild
4. All pages pre-rendered at build time
