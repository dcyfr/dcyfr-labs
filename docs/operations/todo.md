---

## 🟢 Recent Completion: Performance Optimizations (Dec 5, 2025) ✅

Implemented three high-impact performance optimizations to improve Core Web Vitals:

- [x] **Blur Placeholders for Images** ✅
  - Created `IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER` constant in design-tokens.ts
  - Added blur placeholders to 7 Image components across 6 files

---

## 🟢 Recent Completion: Performance Monitoring & Analytics Infrastructure (Dec 5, 2025) ✅

**Bundle Size Monitoring with Baseline Comparison** ✅

- [x] **Enhanced Bundle Size Monitor** ✅ (Dec 5, 2025 - 1 hour)
  - Created `performance-baselines.json` with configurable regression thresholds
  - Enhanced `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs` with baseline comparison logic
  - Implemented three-tier regression detection: <10% pass, 10-25% warning, >25% error
  - Added CI integration in `.github/workflows/test.yml` (new "Bundle Size Check" job)
  - **Next.js 16/Turbopack Compatible:** Handles new build manifest structure
  - **Status:** Ready for baseline collection after first production deployment

- [x] **Regression Thresholds Configured** ✅
  - **Bundles:** 10% warning, 25% error (prevents bundle bloat)
  - **Lighthouse:** 5-point warning, 10-point error (maintains quality scores)
  - **Web Vitals:** 15% warning, 30% error (protects Core Web Vitals)
  - **Strategy:** Configurable via `performance-baselines.json` for team flexibility

**Analytics Data Flow Documentation** ✅

- [x] **Custom Redis-Backed Analytics System** ✅ (Fully Operational)
  - **Architecture:** Hybrid approach (Custom Redis primary + Vercel Analytics supplementary)
  - **Reason:** Vercel Analytics has no data retrieval API (dashboard-only view)
  - **Custom System Capabilities:**
    - Real-time view tracking with 5-layer anti-spam protection
    - Session deduplication (30-minute window)
    - IP rate limiting (10 views per 5 minutes)
    - Visibility API validation (only counts visible pageviews)
    - User-agent filtering (blocks bots)
    - Abuse pattern detection (tracks repeat offenders)

  - **Redis Key Structure:**
    - `views:post:{id}` - Total view count (permanent)
    - `views:post:{id}:timestamps` - View timestamps (24h sorted set, auto-cleanup)
    - `views:post:{id}:day:{date}` - Daily views (90-day retention)
    - `shares:post:{id}` - Total shares (permanent)
    - `blog:trending` - Top 10 trending posts (1-hour cache)
    - `blog:milestone:{id}:{count}` - Milestone timestamps (permanent)
    - `session:view:{id}` - Session deduplication (30-minute expiry)

  - **Milestone Detection:** 100, 1K, 10K, 50K, 100K views with cascade events
  - **Trending Algorithm:** `score = recentViews * (recentViews / totalViews)`
  - **Scheduled Jobs:**
    - `calculateTrending` - Hourly trending posts calculation
    - `dailyAnalyticsSummary` - Daily analytics at midnight UTC

  - **Security:**
    - Analytics API blocked in production (requires API key + rate limiting)
    - 5-layer anti-spam protection on view tracking
    - Audit logging for all access attempts
    - Fail-closed rate limiting on contact forms

- [x] **Vercel Analytics Integration Enhanced** ✅ (Dec 5, 2025 - 30 minutes)
  - **Server-Side Tracking Implemented:** Complete visibility into background jobs
  - **Tracked Events:**
    - `blog_post_viewed` - Post view with metadata (postId, slug, title, totalViews)
    - `blog_milestone_reached` - Milestone achievements (slug, milestone, totalViews)
    - `trending_posts_calculated` - Trending calculation runs (count, topPostId)
    - `analytics_summary_generated` - Daily summaries (period, totalViews, uniquePosts)
    - `contact_form_submitted` - Form submissions (emailDomain, success status)
  - **Implementation:** Added `track()` calls from `@vercel/analytics/server` in Inngest functions
  - **Benefit:** Holistic view across both custom Redis analytics and Vercel dashboard

**Historical Data Storage Strategy** ✅

- [x] **14-Day Retention via GitHub Actions** ✅ (Current Strategy)
  - Lighthouse CI results stored as artifacts (14-day automatic expiry)
  - Bundle size data logged in CI runs (14-day retention)
  - **Rationale:** Sufficient for immediate regression detection and trend spotting
  - **Future Migration Path:** When data volume or retention requirements increase:
    - Option A: Vercel Blob storage for long-term historical data
    - Option B: Redis with extended retention policies
    - Decision deferred until data shows need (data-driven approach)

**Status Summary:**

- ✅ Bundle monitoring: Enhanced with baseline comparison + CI enforcement
- ✅ Analytics: Redis-backed with 5-layer security, fully operational
- ✅ Vercel tracking: Server-side events implemented for complete visibility
- ✅ Historical storage: 14-day retention sufficient, migration path documented
- ⏳ Baseline collection: Pending first production deployment
- ⏳ Vercel Speed Insights alerts: Configure in dashboard post-deployment

**Next Steps:**

1. Deploy to preview branch (trigger production build)
2. Run Lighthouse CI manually to collect baseline scores
3. Extract bundle sizes from build output
4. Populate `performance-baselines.json` with actual metrics
5. Document baselines in `performance-review-log.md`
6. Configure Vercel Speed Insights alerts in dashboard
  - Production build successful
  - Lint check clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)

**Current State:** Perfect code quality - ready for new development

## 🟢 Recent Completion: Blog Frontmatter Improvements (Dec 4, 2025) ✅

Comprehensive audit and standardization of blog post metadata:

- [x] **Timezone-Safe Timestamps** ✅
  - All 9 posts updated with full ISO timestamps (`2025-12-03T12:00:00Z`)
  - Fixed date display bug (CVE post showing Dec 2 instead of Dec 3)
  - Prevents timezone-related display issues across all posts

- [x] **Metadata Consistency** ✅
  - Added missing `updatedAt` field to CVE post
  - Fixed copy-pasted image metadata in 2 posts (hardening, shipping)
  - Added consistent `credit: "Default Blog Image"` to all placeholder images

- [x] **Image Metadata Accuracy** ✅
  - Updated alt text and captions to match actual post content
  - Removed incorrect AI/MCP references from portfolio posts
  - Ensured all image metadata is descriptive and relevant

**Standards Established:**

- Always use full timestamps: `publishedAt: "2025-12-04T12:00:00Z"`
- Include `updatedAt` on all posts (even if same as publishedAt)
- Image metadata must match post content (alt, caption, credit)
- Consistent field ordering across all posts

**Future Opportunities Identified:**

- 8/9 posts use placeholder images - consider custom hero images
- Add SEO fields: keywords, author, readingTime
- Add organization fields: series, relatedPosts
- Separate social media images: ogImage, twitterCard
