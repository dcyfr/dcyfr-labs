# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts for development, testing, and maintenance tasks.

> **Note:** On November 14, 2025, obsolete ad-hoc test scripts were archived to `archive/legacy-tests/` and replaced with modern testing infrastructure (Vitest, Playwright, Lighthouse CI). See [npm-scripts-cleanup-2025-11-14.md](/docs/operations/npm-scripts-cleanup-2025-11-14.md) for details.

## Archived Scripts

### Legacy Test Scripts (archived November 14, 2025)

One-off development test scripts moved to `scripts/archive/legacy-tests/`. These have been superseded by proper testing infrastructure:

- **Vitest** (`npm run test`) for unit and integration tests
- **Playwright** (`npm run test:e2e`) for E2E tests  
- **Lighthouse CI** (`npm run lighthouse:ci`) for performance and accessibility validation

See `scripts/archive/legacy-tests/README.md` for complete list and migration guidance.

### Historical Scripts

One-time debug and migration scripts are in `scripts/archive/`. See `scripts/archive/README.md` for details.

## Adding New Scripts

When adding new scripts:
1. Use `.mjs` extension for ES modules
2. Add shebang line: `#!/usr/bin/env node`
3. Include descriptive comment header
4. Update this README with script description and usage
5. Consider adding an npm script alias in `package.json` if frequently used
