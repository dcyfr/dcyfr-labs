## ⚪ Backlog

Items deferred until data validates need or time permits.

### Testing & Quality

- [ ] Fix design token linting warnings (2-3 hours)
  - 29 warnings for improper spacing classes (space-y-8, space-y-6 instead of SPACING tokens)
  - Affected files: activity-client.tsx, AnalyticsClient.tsx, blog/[slug]/page.tsx, dev pages
  - Replace hardcoded padding/margin with design tokens from @/lib/design-tokens
  - Replace hardcoded typography classes with TYPOGRAPHY tokens

- [ ] Fix React 19 test failures - 11 tests (2-3 hours)
  - Wrap Mermaid async state updates in act()
  - Fix rate limiting test timing issues
  - Fix error scenario integration tests

- [ ] Fix broken Sentry MCP integration (1 hour)
  - MCP server returning 404 for organization `dcyfr-labs-gj` (should be `dcyfr-labs`)
  - Update VS Code Sentry MCP extension settings with correct org
  - Test with `mcp_sentry_find_organizations` tool

- [x] **CodeQL Configuration** ✅ (Nov 29, 2025)
  - Disabled default setup conflicting with advanced workflow
  - Advanced `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` now runs without SARIF errors

### Infrastructure & Reliability

- [ ] Backup & disaster recovery plan (2 hours)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI improvements (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Automated performance regression tests (3-4 hours)

## 🔧 Current Short-Term Tasks (Next day)

- [ ] Stabilize E2E (Mobile) - (1-2 hours)
  - Investigate intermittent failures on Mobile Safari (WebKit) where the MobileNav trigger remains disabled until mount.
  - Add small Playwright helper for reliably opening the mobile nav (ensures enabled state or force-click fallback).
  - If the component mount behavior causes issues, consider refactoring `MobileNav` to remove the disabled pre-mount placeholder or render a visible, accessible fallback.

- [ ] Validate E2E Production Build Runs in CI - (30-60 minutes)
  - CI now runs Playwright with production build by default (PLAYWRIGHT_USE_PROD=1).
  - Validate full Playwright runs against production build on an ephemeral environment.

- [ ] Investigate Dev Overlay Artifact - (30-45 minutes)
  - Dev overlay (Next.js dev overlay) previously interfered with E2E interactions. Running tests against the production build should resolve it; verify and document findings.

- [x] Add Playwright utility for mobile nav and update `e2e` tests - (1 hour)
  - Create a shared helper in `e2e/utils` to open mobile nav with robust retries and logging.
