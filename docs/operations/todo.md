## 🟢 Recent Completion: Performance Monitoring & Analytics Infrastructure (Dec 5, 2025) ✅

**Bundle Size Monitoring with Baseline Comparison** ✅

- [x] **Enhanced Bundle Size Monitor** ✅ (Dec 5, 2025 - 1 hour)
  - Created `performance-baselines.json` with configurable regression thresholds
  - Enhanced `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs` with baseline comparison logic
  - Implemented three-tier regression detection: <10% pass, 10-25% warning, >25% error
  - Added CI integration in `.github/workflows/test.yml` (new "Bundle Size Check" job)
  - **Next.js 16/Turbopack Compatible:** Handles new build manifest structure
  - **Status:** Ready for baseline collection after first production deployment

- [x] **Regression Thresholds Configured** ✅
  - **Bundles:** 10% warning, 25% error (prevents bundle bloat)
  - **Lighthouse:** 5-point warning, 10-point error (maintains quality scores)
  - **Web Vitals:** 15% warning, 30% error (protects Core Web Vitals)
  - **Strategy:** Configurable via `performance-baselines.json` for team flexibility

**Analytics Data Flow Documentation** ✅

- [x] **Custom Redis-Backed Analytics System** ✅ (Fully Operational)
  - **Architecture:** Hybrid approach (Custom Redis primary + Vercel Analytics supplementary)
  - **Reason:** Vercel Analytics has no data retrieval API (dashboard-only view)
  - **Custom System Capabilities:**
    - Real-time view tracking with 5-layer anti-spam protection
    - Session deduplication (30-minute window)
    - IP rate limiting (10 views per 5 minutes)
    - Visibility API validation (only counts visible pageviews)
    - User-agent filtering (blocks bots)
    - Abuse pattern detection (tracks repeat offenders)

  - **Redis Key Structure:**
    - `views:post:{id}` - Total view count (permanent)
    - `views:post:{id}:timestamps` - View timestamps (24h sorted set, auto-cleanup)
    - `views:post:{id}:day:{date}` - Daily views (90-day retention)
    - `shares:post:{id}` - Total shares (permanent)
    - `blog:trending` - Top 10 trending posts (1-hour cache)
    - `blog:milestone:{id}:{count}` - Milestone timestamps (permanent)
    - `session:view:{id}` - Session deduplication (30-minute expiry)

  - **Milestone Detection:** 100, 1K, 10K, 50K, 100K views with cascade events
  - **Trending Algorithm:** `score = recentViews * (recentViews / totalViews)`
  - **Scheduled Jobs:**
    - `calculateTrending` - Hourly trending posts calculation
    - `dailyAnalyticsSummary` - Daily analytics at midnight UTC

  - **Security:**
    - Analytics API blocked in production (requires API key + rate limiting)
    - 5-layer anti-spam protection on view tracking
    - Audit logging for all access attempts
    - Fail-closed rate limiting on contact forms

- [x] **Vercel Analytics Integration Enhanced** ✅ (Dec 5, 2025 - 30 minutes)
  - **Server-Side Tracking Implemented:** Complete visibility into background jobs
  - **Tracked Events:**
    - `blog_post_viewed` - Post view with metadata (postId, slug, title, totalViews)
    - `blog_milestone_reached` - Milestone achievements (slug, milestone, totalViews)
    - `trending_posts_calculated` - Trending calculation runs (count, topPostId)
    - `analytics_summary_generated` - Daily summaries (period, totalViews, uniquePosts)
    - `contact_form_submitted` - Form submissions (emailDomain, success status)
  - **Implementation:** Added `track()` calls from `@vercel/analytics/server` in Inngest functions
  - **Benefit:** Holistic view across both custom Redis analytics and Vercel dashboard

**Historical Data Storage Strategy** ✅

- [x] **14-Day Retention via GitHub Actions** ✅ (Current Strategy)
  - Lighthouse CI results stored as artifacts (14-day automatic expiry)
  - Bundle size data logged in CI runs (14-day retention)
  - **Rationale:** Sufficient for immediate regression detection and trend spotting
  - **Future Migration Path:** When data volume or retention requirements increase:
    - Option A: Vercel Blob storage for long-term historical data
    - Option B: Redis with extended retention policies
    - Decision deferred until data shows need (data-driven approach)

**Status Summary:**

- ✅ Bundle monitoring: Enhanced with baseline comparison + CI enforcement
- ✅ Analytics: Redis-backed with 5-layer security, fully operational
- ✅ Vercel tracking: Server-side events implemented for complete visibility
- ✅ Historical storage: 14-day retention sufficient, migration path documented
- ⏳ Baseline collection: Pending first production deployment
- ⏳ Vercel Speed Insights alerts: Configure in dashboard post-deployment

**Next Steps:**

1. Deploy to preview branch (trigger production build)
2. Run Lighthouse CI manually to collect baseline scores
3. Extract bundle sizes from build output
4. Populate `performance-baselines.json` with actual metrics
5. Document baselines in `performance-review-log.md`
6. Configure Vercel Speed Insights alerts in dashboard
7. **Add `VERCEL_TOKEN` to GitHub secrets for Vercel Checks API**

## 🟢 Recent Completion: Vercel Deployment Checks Integration (Dec 5, 2025) ✅

**Automated Quality Gates for Every Deployment** ✅

- [x] **GitHub Action Workflow Created** ✅ (Dec 5, 2025 - 1 hour)
  - Created `.github/workflows/vercel-checks.yml`
  - Triggers on `deployment_status` events from Vercel
  - Registers 3 checks via Vercel Checks API:
    1. **Bundle Size Validation** - Runs `check-bundle-size.mjs`, compares against baselines
    2. **Lighthouse Performance** - Audits 5 pages (3 runs each), validates Core Web Vitals
    3. **Performance Baseline Validation** - Aggregates results, blocks on critical regressions

- [x] **Check Lifecycle Implementation** ✅
  - **Create check** → Sets status to `running` with details URL
  - **Run validation** → Executes bundle/Lighthouse scripts
  - **Update check** → Sets conclusion (`succeeded`/`failed`/`neutral`) with detailed output
  - **Block deployment** → Vercel prevents production alias if checks fail

- [x] **Blocking Behavior Configured** ✅
  - Critical failures block deployment:
    - Bundle size >25% regression (error threshold)
    - Lighthouse score decreases >10 points (error threshold)
    - Performance <90% or Accessibility <95%
  - Warnings allow deployment (neutral conclusion):
    - Bundle size 10-25% regression
    - Lighthouse score decreases 5-10 points
  - Success allows deployment (succeeded conclusion)

- [x] **Integration Documentation** ✅
  - Created `docs/platform/vercel-deployment-checks.md`
  - Complete setup guide (requires `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret)
  - Check lifecycle diagrams and examples
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Comparison: Vercel Checks vs GitHub Actions only

**Benefits:**

1. **Automated Quality Gates** - No bad deployments reach production
2. **Visual Feedback** - See check status in Vercel dashboard before deployment goes live
3. **Configurable Thresholds** - Team controls sensitivity via `performance-baselines.json`
4. **Detailed Reports** - Full bundle analysis + Lighthouse scores in check output
5. **Rerun Failed Checks** - Click to rerun without redeploying
6. **Team Visibility** - Dashboard + notifications for all stakeholders

**Setup Required:**

- [ ] Add `VERCEL_TOKEN` to GitHub repository secrets
  - Go to [Vercel Account → Tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
  - Create token with `Deployments (Read & Write)` scope
  - Add to GitHub: `Settings → Secrets → New secret: VERCEL_TOKEN`
- [ ] Verify Vercel GitHub App integration is active
- [ ] Test workflow on next deployment to preview branch

**Files Created:**
1. `.github/workflows/vercel-checks.yml` (395 lines) - Workflow with 3 checks
2. `docs/platform/vercel-deployment-checks.md` - Complete documentation

**Quality Verification:**
- ✅ Workflow syntax validated
