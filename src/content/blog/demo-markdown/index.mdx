## Typography Styles

### Heading Level 3

This is how a third-level heading looks with the current typography system.

#### Heading Level 4

Fourth-level headings are slightly smaller but still maintain hierarchy.

##### Heading Level 5

Fifth-level headings for deeply nested content.

###### Heading Level 6

The smallest heading level available.

---

## Text Formatting

You can use **bold text** for emphasis, _italic text_ for subtle emphasis, and **_bold italic_** for maximum emphasis. Use ~~strikethrough~~ for deleted text.

Inline `code snippets` are styled with monospace font and background highlighting. You can also use <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> to show keyboard shortcuts.

This paragraph includes a [link to Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and an external link with proper styling.

## Blockquotes

> This is a single-line blockquote.

## Horizontal Rules

Three or more dashes create a horizontal rule:

---

Three or more asterisks also work:

---

Three or more underscores as well:

---

---

## Images

![Avatar](/images/avatar.jpg)

_Image caption: This is how images render with optional captions._

---

## Math & LaTeX (KaTeX)

Inline math equations render with KaTeX: $E = mc^2$ is Einstein's famous equation.

Block math equations are centered on their own line:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Complex expressions work too:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

## Icon Components

MDX supports custom icon components for consistent styling across the site:

### Status Icons

- ✓ Features that are available
- ✗ Features that are not available
- ⚠ Features that need attention

### Contextual Icons

- ⓘ Helpful information and tips
- <IdeaIcon /> Pro tips and best practices
- <ZapIcon /> Performance and speed features
- <RocketIcon /> New launches and releases
- <LockIcon /> Security and private features
- ↩ Return or continuation indicators

### Icon Tables

Icons work great in tables for feature comparison:

|      Icon      | Name    | Use Case                       |
| :------------: | ------- | ------------------------------ |
|       ✓        | Check   | Success, completion, available |
|       ✗        | Cross   | Error, unavailable, denied     |
|       ⚠       | Warning | Caution, deprecation           |
|       ⓘ        | Info    | Helpful notes, documentation   |
|  <IdeaIcon />  | Idea    | Tips, insights                 |
|  <ZapIcon />   | Zap     | Performance, speed             |
| <RocketIcon /> | Rocket  | Launch, deployment             |
|  <LockIcon />  | Lock    | Security, privacy              |

## HTML Elements

You can also use HTML elements when needed:

<div className="p-4 bg-accent rounded-lg my-4">
  <strong>Custom HTML:</strong> This is a custom HTML element styled with
  Tailwind classes.
</div>

<CollapsibleSection id="html-details-example" title="Click to expand">

Hidden content that reveals when you click the summary.

- Can contain markdown
- Including lists
- And other elements

</CollapsibleSection>

---

## Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote reference[^1].

You can also use named footnotes[^note].

[^1]: This is the first footnote with more detailed information about the topic.

[^note]: Named footnotes are easier to maintain in long documents.

---

## Interactive Diagrams

The site supports interactive diagrams for flowcharts and architecture visualizations:

<PipelineFlow height={600} />

---

## Combinations

You can combine multiple markdown elements:

> **Important Note:**
>
> When working with TypeScript, remember to:
>
> 1. Define proper types for all function parameters
> 2. Use interfaces for object shapes
> 3. Leverage generics for reusable code
>
> See the [Code Examples](/blog/demo-code) for detailed examples.
