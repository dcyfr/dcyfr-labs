# Completed Work Archive

This document tracks **recently completed** work. Historical completions are archived separately.

**Last Updated:** December 7, 2025 | **System:** Token-optimized with monthly archives

---

## 📋 Archive System

**How This Works:**
- **Recent completions** (current month) live here for quick reference
- **Older completions** (previous months) archived in `archive/` directory
- **Historical reference** - See `docs/operations/archive/` for past sessions
- **Token efficiency** - Main file stays <500 lines

**Latest Archive Files:**
- `archive/2025-11/completed-work-november.md` - November completions (45+ items)
- `archive/2025-12-early/` - Created as needed for early December
