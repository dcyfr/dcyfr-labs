name: Test (Optimized) - DEPRECATED

# ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE
# This workflow has been merged into test.yml
# 
# Status: INACTIVE (2026-01-13)
# Reason: All optimizations from this workflow have been integrated into test.yml
# 
# The following features from this workflow are now in test.yml:
# ✅ Conditional E2E execution (skip on docs-only PRs)
# ✅ Preview branch support
# ✅ Optimized caching strategies
# ✅ Test summary reporting
# 
# DO NOT use this workflow. It will be removed in February 2026.
# Use test.yml instead: .github/workflows/test.yml
# 
# To verify all features are in test.yml:
# 1. Check test.yml has determine-scope job
# 2. Check e2e job uses: if: needs.determine-scope.outputs.run_e2e == 'true'
# 3. Check test.yml includes preview branch in push/PR triggers
# 4. Check test-summary job exists at end of file
#
