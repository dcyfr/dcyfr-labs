## Quick Start

### Creating Your First Post

1. **Create a new MDX file:**
   ```bash
   touch src/content/blog/my-awesome-post.mdx
   ```

2. **Add frontmatter and content:**
   ```mdx
   ---
   title: "My Awesome Post"
   summary: "A brief description that appears in listings and social previews"
   publishedAt: "2025-10-24"
   tags: ["tutorial", "next.js"]
   featured: false
   ---

   ## Introduction

   Your content starts here...
   ```

3. **Preview locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000/blog/my-awesome-post
   ```

4. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add src/content/blog/my-awesome-post.mdx
   git commit -m "Add: My Awesome Post"
   git push
   ```

**That's it!** The post is now live (or in draft mode if you set `draft: true`).

---

## File Structure

### Location

All blog posts live in:
```
src/content/blog/
├── my-first-post.mdx
├── another-post.mdx
└── latest-post.mdx
```

### Naming Conventions

**File names become URL slugs:**
- `my-first-post.mdx` → `/blog/my-first-post`
- `shipping-tiny-portfolio.mdx` → `/blog/shipping-tiny-portfolio`
- `nextjs-app-router-guide.mdx` → `/blog/nextjs-app-router-guide`

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Use lowercase letters
- ✅ Separate words with hyphens (`-`)
- ✅ Keep slugs concise but descriptive
- ✅ Use keywords for SEO
- ❌ Avoid special characters (`!`, `@`, `#`, etc.)
- ❌ Avoid underscores (use hyphens instead)
- ❌ Avoid dates in filenames (use frontmatter instead)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Good
building-a-blog-with-nextjs.mdx
mastering-typescript-generics.mdx
css-grid-layout-guide.mdx

# Avoid
2025-10-24-my-post.mdx        # Date in filename
My_Post_Title.mdx             # Underscores and capitals
my-post!!!.mdx                # Special characters
```

---

## Frontmatter Configuration

Frontmatter is YAML metadata at the top of each MDX file, enclosed in `---` markers.

### Required Fields

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
summary: "A brief description (150-160 chars recommended)"
publishedAt: "2025-10-24"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

---

## SEO Best Practices

### Title Optimization

**Guidelines:**
- 50-60 characters for optimal display in search results
- Include primary keyword near the beginning
- Make it compelling and click-worthy
- Use pipes (`|`) or colons (`:`) for subtitles

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Good
title: "Next.js App Router: Complete Guide to Server Components"
title: "TypeScript Generics Explained | Practical Examples"
title: "CSS Grid Layout: From Basics to Advanced Techniques"

# Avoid
title: "My Post"  # Too vague
title: "The Complete Comprehensive Ultra-Detailed Guide to Everything About Building Modern Web Applications with Next.js"  # Too long
```

### Summary/Meta Description

**Guidelines:**
- 150-160 characters for optimal search result display
- Include primary and secondary keywords naturally
- Describe what readers will learn or gain
- Include a call to action when appropriate

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Good
summary: "Learn how to use TypeScript generics to build reusable, type-safe functions and classes. Includes practical examples and common patterns."

summary: "A step-by-step guide to migrating from Pages Router to App Router in Next.js, with code examples and best practices."

# Avoid
summary: "A post about Next.js"  # Too vague
summary: "Read this now!"  # No information
```

### Tags for Discoverability

**Guidelines:**
- Use 2-5 tags per post
- Check existing tags for consistency
- Mix broad and specific tags
- Consider what readers might search for

**Example Strategy:**
```yaml
tags: ["Next.js", "Tutorial", "Performance"]
# "Next.js" - broad category
# "Tutorial" - content type
# "Performance" - specific topic
```

### URL Slugs

**Guidelines:**
- Keep slugs short but descriptive
- Include primary keyword
- Use hyphens to separate words
- Avoid stop words when possible

**Examples:**
```bash
# Good
nextjs-app-router-guide.mdx
typescript-generics-tutorial.mdx
css-grid-layout-basics.mdx

# Avoid
post1.mdx                    # Not descriptive
the-ultimate-guide-to-using-nextjs-app-router-in-2025.mdx  # Too long
```

### Content Freshness

**Update Strategy:**
1. Add `updatedAt` for significant revisions
2. Add update notices for major changes
3. Archive outdated content instead of deleting
4. Refresh featured posts periodically

**Example Update Notice:**
```mdx
> **Update (Oct 2025):** This post has been updated to reflect Next.js 16 and React 19 changes. The original concepts still apply.
```

---

## Workflow Guide

### Creating a New Post

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Research existing content:**
   ```bash
   # List all posts
   ls src/content/blog/
   
   # Check existing tags
   grep -h "^tags:" src/content/blog/*.mdx | sort | uniq
   ```

2. **Create the file:**
   ```bash
   touch src/content/blog/your-post-slug.mdx
   ```

3. **Start with frontmatter template:**
   ```mdx
   ---
   title: ""
   summary: ""
   publishedAt: "YYYY-MM-DD"
   tags: []
   draft: true
   ---
   ```

4. **Write content:**
   - Start with introduction
   - Build out main sections
   - Add code examples
   - Write conclusion

5. **Preview locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000/blog/your-post-slug
   ```

6. **Iterate and refine:**
   - Check formatting
   - Test code examples
   - Review headings for TOC
   - Proofread content

7. **Publish:**
   ```yaml
   draft: false  # Change from true to false
   ```

8. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add src/content/blog/your-post-slug.mdx
   git commit -m "Add: Your Post Title"
   git push
   ```

### Updating Existing Posts

**Minor Updates (typos, formatting):**
```bash
# Edit the file
vim src/content/blog/post-slug.mdx

# Commit
git add src/content/blog/post-slug.mdx
git commit -m "Fix: Typo in post title"
git push
```

**Major Updates (content changes):**
```mdx
---
title: "..."
summary: "..."
publishedAt: "2025-09-10"
updatedAt: "2025-10-24"  # Add this
---

> **Update (Oct 2025):** This post has been updated with new information about [topic].

[rest of content...]
```

### Archiving Posts

**When technology/info becomes outdated:**

1. Add `archived: true` to frontmatter
2. Add archive notice at top
3. Update summary if needed
4. Keep content for historical reference

**Example:**
```mdx
---
title: "Getting Started with Webpack 4"
archived: true
updatedAt: "2025-10-24"
---

> **Archived:** This post covers Webpack 4, which has been superseded by Webpack 5 and alternatives like Vite. Content preserved for historical reference.
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Series Posts

**Link related posts in sequence:**

```mdx
---
title: "Part 1: Introduction to TypeScript"
tags: ["TypeScript", "Series"]
---

> **Series:** This is Part 1 of 3. Continue with [Part 2: Advanced Types](/blog/typescript-part-2) and [Part 3: Generics](/blog/typescript-part-3).

## Introduction
...
```

**End with next post link:**
```markdown
## Next Steps

Continue to [Part 2: Advanced Types](/blog/typescript-part-2) to learn about union types, intersection types, and type guards.
```

### Update Notices

**At the top of post:**
```mdx
> **Update (Oct 2025):** This post is now part of a series! Check out [Part 2: Advanced Topics](/blog/post-part-2) for the follow-up.
```

**For deprecation:**
```mdx
> **Deprecation Notice:** The approach described here has been replaced by [newer method]. See [Updated Guide](/blog/new-guide) for current best practices.
```

### Code Samples with Explanations

**Pattern:**
```markdown
Here's how to implement this feature:

```typescript
export function myFunction(param: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${param}!`;
}
```

**Key points:**
- The function takes a `string` parameter
- It returns a formatted string
- TypeScript enforces type safety
```

### External References

```yaml
sources:
  - label: "Official Documentation"
    href: "https://example.com/docs"
  - label: "GitHub Repository"
    href: "https://github.com/user/repo"
```

**In content:**
```markdown
For more details, see the [official documentation](https://example.com/docs).
```

## Troubleshooting

### Post Not Showing Up

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ File is in `src/content/blog/` directory
2. ✅ File has `.mdx` extension
3. ✅ Frontmatter is valid YAML (no syntax errors)
4. ✅ All required fields present (`title`, `summary`, `publishedAt`, `tags`)
5. ✅ Not marked as `draft: true` (if in production)
6. ✅ Build succeeded without errors

**Debug:**
```bash
# Rebuild the project
npm run build

# Check for errors in logs
# Verify post appears in build output
```

### Syntax Highlighting Not Working

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Code block has language identifier
2. ✅ Language is supported by Shiki
3. ✅ No extra spaces before/after backticks

**Example:**
````markdown
❌ Wrong:
``` typescript
const x = 1;
```

✅ Correct:
```typescript
const x = 1;
```
````

### Table of Contents Empty

**Cause:** Post has no H2 or H3 headings

**Solution:**
```markdown
## First Section

Content here...

### Subsection

More content...
```

### Frontmatter Parsing Errors

**Common Issues:**

1. **Missing quotes around values with colons:**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ Wrong
   title: Next.js: A Guide
   
   # ✅ Correct
   title: "Next.js: A Guide"
   ```

2. **Incorrect date format:**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ Wrong
   publishedAt: 10/24/2025
   publishedAt: Oct 24, 2025
   
   # ✅ Correct
   publishedAt: "2025-10-24"
   ```

3. **Tags not as array:**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ Wrong
   tags: Next.js, React
   
   # ✅ Correct
   tags: ["Next.js", "React"]
   ```

### Build Errors

**"Cannot read property 'title'"**
- Missing required frontmatter field
- Check all required fields are present

**"Invalid date"**
- Check date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Ensure dates are strings in quotes

**"Unexpected token"**
- YAML syntax error in frontmatter
- Check for unescaped special characters
- Ensure proper indentation
