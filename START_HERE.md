## 🔴 What's Broken (Critical)

### Problem #1: Hero Overlay Tests Failing (8 tests)
```
❌ 8 unit tests are failing
├─ Component: src/components/common/hero-overlay.tsx
├─ Issue: Renders h-auto instead of intensity heights (h-24, h-32, h-40)
├─ Cause: Using direction="full" in composite components
└─ Fix: Change to direction="top" + direction="bottom"
```

### Problem #2: Uncommitted CSS Changes
```
❌ 1 file has uncommitted changes
├─ File: src/app/globals.css
├─ Issue: Removing hsl() wrappers from CSS variables
├─ Impact: Breaks scrollbar styling
└─ Fix: git checkout src/app/globals.css
```

## ⚠️ What Needs Work (Quality Gates)

### Issue #3: ESLint Warnings (91 total)
- **56** Hardcoded colors → Replace with design tokens
- **18** Invalid SPACING tokens → Fix template literal usage
- **7** Image optimization → Use Next.js Image component
- **10** Typography issues → Use TYPOGRAPHY tokens

**These don't block deployment but need fixing for CI/CD compliance**

## 🎯 The Fix Plan

### Phase 1: CRITICAL (Must Do) - ~40 minutes
```bash
# 1. Revert CSS changes (5 min)
git checkout src/app/globals.css

# 2. Fix hero-overlay component (25 min)
# Open src/components/common/hero-overlay.tsx
# Follow exact code changes in HERO_OVERLAY_ROOT_CAUSE.md

# 3. Verify tests pass (10 min)
npm run test:unit -- hero-overlay
```

### Phase 2: QUALITY (Should Do) - ~2 hours
```bash
# 1. Fix SPACING tokens (30 min)
# 2. Replace hardcoded colors (60 min)
# 3. Update img tags (20 min)

npm run lint:fix  # Auto-fixes some issues
npm run check     # Verify all checks
```

### Phase 3: FINAL (Validation) - ~30 minutes
```bash
npm run test:unit      # All 1449 tests
npm run build          # Production build
git push origin preview  # Ready for merge
```

## ✅ Success Checklist

After you're done, verify:

- [ ] `git status` → clean (no uncommitted files)
- [ ] `npm run check` → 0 errors (lint + typecheck)
- [ ] `npm run test:unit` → 100% pass (1449/1449)
- [ ] `npm run build` → succeeds without warnings
- [ ] `node scripts/validate-design-tokens.mjs` → passes

When ALL these pass ✓ → **You're ready to deploy!**

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with the critical issues first** (hero-overlay + CSS)
   - These block deployment immediately
   - Only take ~45 minutes to fix

2. **The hero-overlay fix is straightforward**
   - Exactly documented in `HERO_OVERLAY_ROOT_CAUSE.md`
   - Copy-paste the code changes
   - 4 lines of code, max

3. **ESLint warnings can be partially auto-fixed**
   - `npm run lint:fix` handles some automatically
   - Others require manual review

4. **Test as you go**
   - After each fix, run: `npm run test:unit`
   - Catch regressions early
