This page demonstrates all markdown elements and typographic styles used throughout the site. It showcases the **Lora** serif font for body text paired with **Geist Sans** for UI elements.

---

## Typography Styles

### Heading Level 3
This is how a third-level heading looks with the current typography system.

#### Heading Level 4
Fourth-level headings are slightly smaller but still maintain hierarchy.

##### Heading Level 5
Fifth-level headings for deeply nested content.

###### Heading Level 6
The smallest heading level available.

## Text Formatting

You can use **bold text** for emphasis, *italic text* for subtle emphasis, and ***bold italic*** for maximum emphasis. Use ~~strikethrough~~ for deleted text.

Inline `code snippets` are styled with monospace font and background highlighting. You can also use <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> to show keyboard shortcuts.

This paragraph includes a [link to Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and an external link with proper styling.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

- First level item A
- First level item B
  - Second level item B.1
  - Second level item B.2
    - Third level item B.2.1
    - Third level item B.2.2
- First level item C

### Ordered Lists

1. First ordered item
2. Second ordered item
   1. Nested ordered item 2.1
   2. Nested ordered item 2.2
3. Third ordered item

### Task Lists

- [x] Completed task
- [x] Another completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [ ] Another incomplete task

## Blockquotes

> This is a single-line blockquote.

> This is a multi-line blockquote with multiple sentences.
> 
> It can span multiple paragraphs and includes proper spacing and styling to make quoted content stand out from the main text.

> **Pro tip:** Blockquotes can contain **formatted text**, *italics*, and even `code snippets` for maximum flexibility.

## Tables

### Simple Table

| Name    | Role      | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Alice   | Admin     | Active |
| Bob     | Editor    | Active |
| Charlie | Viewer    | Inactive |

### Complex Table with Alignment

| Feature | Free | Pro | Enterprise |
|---------|:----:|:---:|:----------:|
| Users | 1 | 10 | Unlimited |
| Storage | 1GB | 100GB | Custom |
| Support | Email | Priority | 24/7 Phone |
| Custom Domain | <XIcon /> | <CheckIcon /> | <CheckIcon /> |
| API Access | <XIcon /> | Limited | Unlimited |

## Horizontal Rules

Three or more dashes create a horizontal rule:

---

Three or more asterisks also work:

***

Three or more underscores as well:

___

---

## Images

*Image caption: This is how images render with optional captions.*

---

## Math & LaTeX (KaTeX)

Inline math equations render with KaTeX: $E = mc^2$ is Einstein's famous equation.

Block math equations are centered on their own line:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Complex expressions work too:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

## Icon Components

MDX supports custom icon components for consistent styling across the site:

### Status Icons

- <CheckIcon /> Features that are available
- <XIcon /> Features that are not available
- <WarningIcon /> Features that need attention

### Contextual Icons

- <InfoIcon /> Helpful information and tips
- <IdeaIcon /> Pro tips and best practices
- <ZapIcon /> Performance and speed features
- <RocketIcon /> New launches and releases
- <LockIcon /> Security and private features
- <ReturnIcon /> Return or continuation indicators

### Icon Tables

Icons work great in tables for feature comparison:

| Icon | Name | Use Case |
|:----:|------|----------|
| <CheckIcon /> | Check | Success, completion, available |
| <XIcon /> | Cross | Error, unavailable, denied |
| <WarningIcon /> | Warning | Caution, deprecation |
| <InfoIcon /> | Info | Helpful notes, documentation |
| <IdeaIcon /> | Idea | Tips, insights |
| <ZapIcon /> | Zap | Performance, speed |
| <RocketIcon /> | Rocket | Launch, deployment |
| <LockIcon /> | Lock | Security, privacy |

## HTML Elements

You can also use HTML elements when needed:

<div className="p-4 bg-accent rounded-lg my-4">
  <strong>Custom HTML:</strong> This is a custom HTML element styled with Tailwind classes.
</div>

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  
  Hidden content that reveals when you click the summary.
  
  - Can contain markdown
  - Including lists
  - And other elements
</details>

## Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote reference[^1].

You can also use named footnotes[^note].

[^1]: This is the first footnote with more detailed information about the topic.

[^note]: Named footnotes are easier to maintain in long documents.

## Interactive Diagrams

The site supports interactive diagrams for flowcharts and architecture visualizations:

<PipelineFlow height={600} />

## Combinations

You can combine multiple markdown elements:

> **Important Note:**
> 
> When working with TypeScript, remember to:
> 
> 1. Define proper types for all function parameters
> 2. Use interfaces for object shapes
> 3. Leverage generics for reusable code
> 
> See the [Code Examples](/blog/demo-code) for detailed examples.
