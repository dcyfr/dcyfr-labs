# Example: Figure Captions in MDX

This page demonstrates how to use the `Figure` caption component in your blog posts.

## Simple Image with Caption

<Figure caption="A simple landscape photograph demonstrating the figure caption feature">
  ![Example landscape](/images/blog/hero.svg)
</Figure>

## Multiple Figures with Auto-Numbering

Here's a section with multiple figures. Notice how they're automatically numbered in order:

<Figure caption="First figure showing an architecture diagram">
  ![Architecture](/images/blog/hero.svg)
</Figure>

This is some text between figures to show how numbering continues.

<Figure caption="Second figure showing a flow diagram">
  ![Flow](/images/blog/hero.svg)
</Figure>

## How It Works

The `Figure` component:

1. Wraps around any image element
2. Takes a `caption` prop with the text to display
3. Automatically assigns sequential numbers (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, etc.)
4. Renders as semantic HTML (`<figure>` and `<figcaption>`)
5. Figures are numbered in order of appearance across the entire page

## Without Caption

If you need just an image without a caption, simply don't use the `Figure` component:

![Plain image without caption](/images/blog/hero.svg)

## Technical Implementation

The numbering system works through React Context:

- `FigureProvider` wraps the MDX content in blog posts
- Each `Figure` component calls `context.increment()` to get its number
- Numbers persist across the entire provider scope
- Multiple providers can have independent numbering sequences
