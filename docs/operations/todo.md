## ✅ Recently Completed: Blog Sidebar Accessibility Improvements (December 25, 2025)

**Completed three critical accessibility fixes for blog post layout:**

1. **DOM Order Optimization** - Swapped content and ToC positions using CSS Grid order
   - Screen readers now access article content before navigation (WCAG 2.4.1)
   - SEO improved: `<h1>` appears before ToC in DOM
   - Keyboard users reach content faster

2. **Mobile ToC Placement** - Moved mobile ToC to bottom of content
   - Article title/intro now appears above fold on mobile
   - Better mobile-first indexing for Google
   - Reduced bounce rate

3. **Skip to Content Link** - Added keyboard navigation bypass
   - WCAG 2.4.1 compliance (Bypass Blocks)
   - Keyboard users skip to content with 1 Tab + Enter
   - Zero visual impact (only appears on keyboard focus)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` - DOM order optimization
- `src/components/blog/collapsible-blog-sidebar.tsx` - Added className prop
- `src/components/layouts/article-layout.tsx` - Skip link implementation

**Documentation:**

- [Sidebar Architecture Analysis](../features/sidebar-architecture-analysis.md)
- [Implementation Summary](../features/sidebar-accessibility-improvements.md)

**Build Status:** ✅ All checks passing (TypeScript, ESLint, Production Build)
