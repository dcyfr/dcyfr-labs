## Typography Hierarchy

# Heading 1: Main Title

The largest heading, typically used only once per page as the article title.

## Heading 2: Major Sections

Primary section headers that divide your content into major parts.

### Heading 3: Subsections

Secondary headers for breaking down sections into smaller topics.

#### Heading 4: Details

Tertiary headers for fine-grained organization.

##### Heading 5: Minor Points

Fourth-level headers for very specific topics.

###### Heading 6: Smallest Heading

The smallest heading level, rarely used but available.

## Text Formatting

Regular paragraph text provides the foundation for your content. It should be easy to read with appropriate line height and spacing. The system uses a responsive typography scale that adapts to different screen sizes.

You can use **bold text** to emphasize important points, _italic text_ for subtle emphasis, or **_bold italic_** for maximum impact. Use ~~strikethrough~~ for deprecated content or corrections.

Inline `code snippets` are perfect for mentioning variables, functions, or commands within sentences. For example: `npm install` or `const myVariable = true;`.

> Blockquotes are great for highlighting quotes, testimonials, or important callouts. They stand out visually from the main content flow.

---

## Lists and Organization

### Unordered Lists

- First item in the list
- Second item with important details
- Third item
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2
    - Deeply nested item
- Back to top level

### Ordered Lists

1. First step in the process
2. Second step with explanation
3. Third step
   1. Substep A
   2. Substep B
4. Final step

### Task Lists

- [x] Completed task
- [x] Another finished item
- [ ] Pending task
- [ ] Future enhancement

## Custom MDX Components

### KeyTakeaway

<KeyTakeaway>
  The design system ensures visual consistency across all blog posts by using semantic color tokens
  and standardized component patterns. This makes content creation faster and the user experience
  more predictable.
</KeyTakeaway>

### ContextClue

<ContextClue>
  This blog system is built on Next.js 15 with React 19, using TypeScript for type safety and
  Tailwind CSS v4 for styling. The component architecture follows server-first principles with
  selective client-side interactivity.
</ContextClue>

### Alerts

<Alert type="info">
  **Information:** This is a standard informational alert. Use it for helpful tips and general
  information.
</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">
  **Warning:** This is a warning alert. Use it for cautions, deprecations, or important notices that
  need attention.
</Alert>

<Alert type="critical">
  **Critical:** This is a critical alert. Use it for urgent information, breaking changes, or
  security issues.
</Alert>

<Alert type="success">
  **Success:** This is a success alert. Use it for confirmations, achievements, or positive
  outcomes.
</Alert>

## Code Examples

### Inline Code

Use `const`, `let`, or `var` for variable declarations in JavaScript. The `useState` hook is essential for managing component state in React.

### Code Blocks

```typescript
// TypeScript with syntax highlighting
interface BlogPost {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  summary: string;
  publishedAt: string;
  tags: string[];
  featured?: boolean;
}

const createPost = (data: BlogPost): BlogPost => {
  return {
    ...data,
    id: data.id || generateId(),
  };
};

// Arrow function with type inference
const filterFeatured = (posts: BlogPost[]): BlogPost[] => {
  return posts.filter((post) => post.featured === true);
};
```

```javascript
// JavaScript example
function calculateReadingTime(content) {
  const wordsPerMinute = 200;
  const wordCount = content.split(/\s+/).length;
  const minutes = Math.ceil(wordCount / wordsPerMinute);
  return `${minutes} min read`;
}

// ES6 features
const posts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = posts.map((n) => n * 2);
const evens = posts.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0);
```

```jsx
// React component example
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
      <Button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrease</Button>
      <span className="text-2xl font-bold">{count}</span>
      <Button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```python
# Python example with syntax highlighting
def fibonacci(n: int) -> list[int]:
    """Generate Fibonacci sequence up to n terms."""
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]

    sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        sequence.append(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])

    return sequence

# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
evens = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]
```

```bash
# Shell commands
npm install next@latest react@latest

# Multiple commands

### React 19 Concurrent Features

```tsx
// React 19 with concurrent features
import { use, Suspense } from 'react';

function UserProfile({ userPromise }: { userPromise: Promise<User> }) {
  const user = use(userPromise); // React 19 use() hook

  return (
    <div className="p-6 space-y-4">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground">{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const userPromise = fetchUser('123');

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<UserSkeleton />}>
      <UserProfile userPromise={userPromise} />

## Links and Navigation

Regular links work as expected: [Link to homepage](/) or [External link to Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

Auto-linking for headings is enabled, so you can link directly to sections: [Jump to Typography](#typography-hierarchy)

---

## Horizontal Rules

Use horizontal rules to create visual breaks between sections:

---

Like that!

---

## Tables

Tables are fully responsive and styled with the design system:

| Feature             | Status     | Priority | Notes                              |
| ------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| MDX Support         | ✓ Shipped  | High     | Full MDX rendering with components |
| Syntax Highlighting | ✓ Shipped  | High     | Shiki with multiple themes         |
| Dark Mode           | ✓ Shipped  | High     | CSS variable based theming         |
| Search              | ✓ Shipped  | Medium   | Client-side fuzzy search           |
| Comments            | ⏳ Planned | Low      | Considering giscus integration     |
| Analytics           | ✓ Shipped  | Medium   | View counts and trending           |

### Complex Table

| Language   | Type        | Use Case     | Performance | Learning Curve |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| TypeScript | Compiled    | Web Apps     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | Medium         |
| Python     | interpreted | Data Science | ⭐⭐⭐      | Easy           |

## Special Characters and Emojis

The system automatically handles smart typography:

- Em dashes---like this
- Ellipsis...
- "Smart quotes" and 'single quotes'
- Apostrophes don't break

Icon components for visual indicators:

- <RocketIcon /> Launch and deployment
- ✓ Success and completion
- ✗ Errors and failures
- ⚠ Caution and warnings
- <IdeaIcon /> Tips and insights
- <LockIcon /> Security and privacy
- <ZapIcon /> Performance and speed
- <IdeaIcon /> Lightbulb
- <ZapIcon /> Lightning
- <LockIcon /> Lock
- <RocketIcon /> Rocket

---

## Math Equations

Inline math: The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, which is fundamental to algebra.

Display math (block):

$$
E = mc^2
$$

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

---

## Nested Content

You can combine multiple elements for rich content:

1. **First**: Start with a numbered list

   > Add a blockquote within the list

   ```typescript
   // Include code examples
   const example = 'nested content';
   ```

2. **Second**: Continue with more items
   - nested unordered list
   - Another nested item

   <KeyTakeaway>Even custom components work inside lists!</KeyTakeaway>

3. **Third**: Complex nesting patterns

   | Column 1 | Column 2  |
   | -------- | --------- |
   | Data     | More data |

   And regular paragraph text flows naturally.

---

## Image Placeholders

While this demo doesn't include actual images, here's how they would work:

![Alt text for accessibility](/blog/images/default/hero.svg)

Images are automatically optimized with Next.js Image component and include:

- Lazy loading
- Responsive sizing
- Click-to-zoom functionality
- Blur placeholder during load

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You can mention keyboard shortcuts: Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> to open the command palette, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy.

---

## Design System Features

### Color Semantics

The design system uses semantic color tokens:

- **Primary**: Brand color for CTAs and links
- **Success**: Green for confirmations
- **Warning**: Yellow/orange for cautions
- **Critical**: Red for errors and urgent items
- **Info**: Blue for informational content

### Spacing Scale

Consistent spacing using design tokens:

- Compact: Small gaps for related items
- Content: Standard spacing between paragraphs
- Subsection: Space between subsections
- Section: Major section breaks
- Page: Top-level page margins

### Animation

Subtle animations enhance the user experience:

- Reveal animations on scroll
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- smooth theme transitions
- Loading states with proper feedback

---

## Accessibility Features

All components are built with accessibility in mind:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast mode compatible
- Focus indicators on interactive elements

---

## Progressive Enhancement

The blog system follows progressive enhancement principles:

1. **Base layer**: Semantic HTML and CSS work without JavaScript
2. **Enhanced layer**: JavaScript adds interactivity where beneficial
3. **Optimized layer**: Client-side features enhance the experience

This ensures content is accessible even if JavaScript fails to load.

---

## Responsive Design

All elements adapt to different screen sizes:

- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints at sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Responsive typography scales
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Optimized layouts for all devices

---

## Performance Optimizations

The system includes several performance features:

- Server-side rendering by default
- Code splitting for client components
- Image optimization with Next.js Image
- CSS extracted and minified
- Lazy loading for below-fold content
- Prefetching for navigation links

---
