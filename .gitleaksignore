# Gitleaks Ignore File
# This file is for ignoring specific findings by their fingerprint hash
#
# To add a fingerprint:
# 1. Run: gitleaks detect --report-format json --report-path report.json
# 2. Find the "Fingerprint" field in the report
# 3. Add it here, one per line
#
# Note: Patterns and allowlists go in .gitleaks.toml, not here
#
# Example:
# abc123def456  # Known false positive in test file
