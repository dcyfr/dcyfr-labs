- [ ] SEO_CONFIG, SECURITY_CONFIG, NAV_CONFIG, THEME_CONFIG (as needed)

### Security & Automation (Low Priority)
- [ ] API security audit - Phase 2 (input validation, middleware, monitoring)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI - Lint, typecheck, build with caching
- [ ] Snyk scan in CI - Authenticated vulnerability checks
- [ ] Husky + lint-staged - Pre-commit prettier and eslint

### Analytics Dashboard Enhancements
**Deferred until Phase 2 SEO/content work validates need:**
- Visual trend charts, sparklines, historical snapshots, tag performance, lifecycle labels, engagement tracking

### ESLint Design Token Migration
**Status**: Quick wins complete (Nov 9, 2025) - 71 warnings backlogged
**Priority**: LOW - Maintenance/polish, no user-facing impact
- [ ] Fix remaining 71 warnings (as time permits when editing files)
- **Reference**: `docs/design/eslint-warnings-quick-ref.md`

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Reliability** (Weeks 1-2, 16-20 hours)
Focus: Infrastructure that prevents problems

1. ✅ Accessibility audit follow-up (4-6 hours)
2. ✅ Uptime monitoring (30 min)
3. ✅ Security advisory monitoring (1 hour)
4. ✅ Automated dependency updates (4-6 hours)
5. ✅ Basic testing infrastructure (8-12 hours)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 24/7 uptime visibility
- Automated security updates
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- 60%+ test coverage on critical paths
- **4-8 hours/month saved** on manual maintenance

### **Phase 2: Performance & Visibility** (Weeks 3-4, 15-19 hours)
Focus: User experience and discoverability

1. ✅ Performance monitoring + budgets (3-4 hours)
2. ✅ Lighthouse CI integration (2 hours)
3. ✅ SEO enhancement package (6-8 hours)
4. ✅ Content calendar & strategy (2-3 hours)
5. ✅ Analytics data governance (1 hour)
6. ✅ Conversion goal tracking (2 hours)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Core Web Vitals targets met
- Organic search traffic tracking
- 6-12 month content roadmap
- **20-40% organic traffic growth** (3-6 months)

### **Phase 3: Enhancement & Polish** (Ongoing)
Focus: Data-driven improvements

1. ✅ Homepage stats section (30 min)
2. ✅ Popular posts widget (2-3 hours)
3. ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (2-3 hours)
4. ✅ Documentation review (quarterly, 2-4 hours)
5. ✅ Selected enhancements based on analytics

**Approach**: One item per sprint, validate with data before next enhancement

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Getting Started
1. **Check Phase 1 tasks** - Foundation items should be completed first
2. **One item at a time** - Avoid context switching between priorities
3. **Validate before moving on** - Test, document, commit before next item
4. **Update done.md** - Move completed items with date and learnings

### Priority Decision Framework
Ask these questions before adding new items:

1. **Is it critical?** (compliance, security, accessibility) → 🚨 CRITICAL
2. **Does it prevent problems?** (monitoring, backups, testing) → 🔴 HIGH  
3. **Does it drive growth?** (SEO, performance, content) → 🟡 MEDIUM
4. **Is it data-validated?** (analytics show user need) → 🟢 LOW
5. **Is it speculative?** (no user request, no data) → ⚪ BACKLOG or REMOVE

### Before Starting Work
- [ ] Check accessibility impact (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Estimate effort realistically (add 25% buffer)
- [ ] Consider test coverage needs
- [ ] Plan documentation updates
- [ ] Review related components/systems

### Before Committing
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and fix errors
- [ ] Test with `npm run build` (catches type errors)
- [ ] Update blog post `updatedAt` for content changes
- [ ] Test in multiple browsers if UI changes
- [ ] Review Lighthouse scores for major UI changes
- [ ] Update documentation if behavior changes
- [ ] Move completed item to `done.md` with date

### Effort Estimates
- **30 min - 2 hours**: Quick wins, config changes, simple components
- **3-6 hours**: New features, API integrations, moderate refactoring  
- **8-12 hours**: Complex features, testing infrastructure, large refactors
- **2+ weeks**: Major projects - break down into smaller milestones

### ROI Indicators
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Must do** - High impact, prevents problems, saves time
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Should do** - Clear value, improves key metrics
- ⭐⭐⭐ **Nice to have** - Positive impact but not urgent
- ⭐⭐ **Low priority** - Marginal benefit, do when time permits
- ⭐ **Questionable** - Consider removing or deferring
