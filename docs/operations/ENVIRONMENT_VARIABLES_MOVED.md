# Environment Variables Documentation Moved

**Previous Location:** `/docs/operations/environment-variables.md`
**New Location:** [`/docs/platform/environment-variables.md`](../platform/environment-variables.md)
**Date Moved:** January 5, 2026
**Reason:** Consolidation - platform configuration is the more appropriate category

## What Happened

The environment variables documentation was duplicated in two locations:
- `/docs/operations/environment-variables.md` (older, 712 lines)
- `/docs/platform/environment-variables.md` (current, 735 lines, last updated Dec 7, 2025)

To eliminate duplication and provide a single source of truth, the platform version was kept as the canonical reference.

## Where to Find It Now

**Canonical location:** [docs/platform/environment-variables.md](../platform/environment-variables.md)

This document includes:
- Complete list of all environment variables
- Priority levels (Required, Recommended, Optional)
- Setup instructions for local and production
- Fallback behavior when variables are missing
- Troubleshooting guide

## Migration Notes

If you have bookmarks or links to the old location, please update them to:
```
docs/platform/environment-variables.md
```
