/**
 * Post Category Types and Labels
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for post categories.
 * This file is safe to import in both client and server components.
 * 
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
 * - Previously, category labels were duplicated in multiple files
 * - Categories in MDX frontmatter didn't match the hardcoded labels
 * - This caused missing category badges on blog lists and post pages
 * 
 * WHEN ADDING NEW CATEGORIES:
 * 1. Add to PostCategory type below
 * 2. Add to POST_CATEGORY_LABEL mapping
 * 3. Use the new category in your MDX frontmatter
 * 
 * DO NOT:
 * - Create duplicate CATEGORY_LABEL maps in other files
 * - Import from @/data/posts in client components (use this file instead)
 * 
 * @see src/__tests__/components/post-badges.test.tsx for regression tests
