## ⚠️ Alert Thresholds

### Sentry Alerts Configured

1. **🟠 Brute Force Alert**
   - Trigger: >10 failed auth attempts
   - Frequency: At most once every 30 minutes
   - Expected: 1/day from automated tests

2. **🔴 Production Access** (if configured)
   - Trigger: Message contains "production"
   - Frequency: Immediate
   - Expected: 0 (should never fire)

### When to Investigate

**🚨 Critical - Immediate Action:**
- Production access alert fires
- >50 failed auth attempts in 1 hour (not from Inngest)
- Unknown IP addresses in brute force attempts
- Sentry shows >100 events in 1 day

**⚠️ Warning - Review within 24h:**
- Automated tests fail to run
- Sentry alerts don't fire for 2+ days
- Axiom logs missing for >6 hours
- Rate limit violations from unknown sources

**ℹ️ Info - Normal:**
- Daily brute force alert at ~6 PM MT
- ~19 events per day from known IPs
- Consistent patterns in Axiom logs

## 🛠️ Quick Troubleshooting

### No Daily Tests Running

```bash
# Check Inngest function status
# → https://app.inngest.com → Functions → daily-security-test

# Verify function is deployed
grep -r "dailySecurityTest" src/app/api/inngest/route.ts

# Check cron schedule
# Should show: { cron: "0 1 * * *" }
```

### No Sentry Events

```bash
# Verify DSN is configured
grep "^SENTRY_DSN" .env.local

# Check Sentry is enabled
grep "enabled:" sentry.server.config.ts

# Test manually
curl -H "x-internal-request: true" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer test" \
     https://your-domain.com/api/analytics
```

### No Axiom Logs

```bash
# Check Vercel integration
# → https://vercel.com → Project → Integrations → Axiom

# Verify structured logging
grep -A 5 "console.log(JSON.stringify" src/app/api/analytics/route.ts

# Test in dev
npm run dev
# Make request and check server logs
```
