I wanted to build a minimalistic, focused portfolio that is fast to load, easy to iterate on, and simple to host. After trying a few prototypes, I settled on a modern stack that prioritizes server rendering, typed data, and tiny bundles.

## Why App Router?

The Next.js App Router represents a fundamental shift toward server-first rendering. Unlike the Pages Router, App Router makes server components the default, which means:

- **Better performance**: Initial page loads are faster since most components render on the server.
- **Improved SEO**: Content is fully rendered before it reaches the browser.
- **Reduced client bundle**: Only interactive components ship JavaScript to the client.
- **Streaming and suspense**: Built-in support for progressive loading.

In this portfolio, I only use client components where it actually matters, theme toggling, the contact form, and a few sprinkle interactions.

## Architecture cheat sheet

```
src/
├── app/           # App Router pages and API routes
├── components/    # Reusable UI components
├── content/       # MDX blog posts with frontmatter
├── data/          # Typed static data (projects, resume)
└── lib/           # Utilities and helpers
```

### Stack deep dive

**Next.js 15 + React 19**
- App Router with server components by default
- Turbopack for lightning-fast dev server (production builds use Webpack)
- File-based metadata with zero config

**TypeScript (strict)**
- Type definitions for posts and projects ensure type safety
- Server routes validate payloads aggressively
- Strict mode catches errors at compile time

**Tailwind CSS v4**
- CSS-first mental model
- Dark mode via CSS variables, no class juggling

**shadcn/ui**
- Accessible Radix primitives (Dialog, Dropdown, Tooltip, etc.)
- Headless building blocks with CVA variants
- Copy-paste component library that you own

## Deployment

Everything lands on Vercel with zero manual knobs. Analytics and Speed Insights are on by default, headers are set via `vercel.json`, and the whole thing stays fast.

## Content Management

Blog posts live as individual MDX files in `src/content/blog/`, parsed at build time with gray-matter for frontmatter. This approach offers:

- **Version control**: Every post is tracked in Git
- **Simple authoring**: Write in Markdown with React components
- **Type safety**: Frontmatter is validated against TypeScript types
- **Build-time rendering**: Posts are statically generated for speed

MDX content is rendered with `next-mdx-remote` and enhanced with rehype plugins for auto-linking headings and GitHub-flavored markdown.

## Takeaways

- Server components encourage you to ask "does this need to be interactive?"
- Tailwind v4 wipes away config noise
- File-based content with MDX provides Git-backed authoring
- Type-safe frontmatter catches errors before deployment

Search and tag filtering are now live without compromising the stack's simplicity, and view counts remain on the roadmap.

## What's Next?

This was just the beginning. After shipping, I spent time hardening the site for production with security improvements, performance optimizations, and developer experience enhancements.
