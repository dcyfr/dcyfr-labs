  - **Problem**: 80 components in root `/components` directory with no logical grouping
  - **Impact**: Difficult navigation, maintenance burden, poor developer experience
  - **Approach**: Create feature-based subdirectories
  - **Completed Tasks**:
    1. ✅ Created new directory structure: `blog/`, `projects/`, `resume/`, `about/`, `home/`, `common/`, `navigation/`, `features/`
    2. ✅ Moved 17 blog components to `components/blog/` (filters, sidebar, post)
    3. ✅ Moved 4 project components to `components/projects/`
    4. ✅ Moved 8 resume components to `components/resume/`
    5. ✅ Moved 9 about/home components to respective directories

  - **ROI**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Daily developer experience dramatically improved

- [x] **Phase 4.2: Extract common filter logic** (3-4 hours) ✅ **COMPLETED** (Nov 25, 2025)
  - **Problem**: 90%+ code duplication across filter components (blog, projects)
  - **Files**: `blog-filters.tsx` (262 lines), `project-filters.tsx` (305 lines)
  - **Impact**: Maintenance burden, inconsistent behavior, bug fixes need multiple efforts
  - **Approach**: Created reusable filter hook and component system
  - **Completed Tasks**:
    1. ✅ Created `components/common/filters/` directory structure
    2. ✅ Created shared types in `types.ts` (5 interfaces)
    3. ✅ Created `use-filter-params.ts` hook (URL parameter management)
    4. ✅ Created `use-filter-search.ts` hook (debounced search with 250ms delay)

  - **Time**: 3.5 hours (on target)
  - **ROI**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Eliminated 411 lines of duplicated code, increased test coverage

- [ ] **Phase 4.3: Add barrel exports** (1-2 hours) 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
  - **Problem**: Only 3 subdirectories have `index.ts` files, verbose imports throughout codebase
  - **Impact**: Harder refactoring, verbose import statements
  - **Approach**: Add `index.ts` to all feature directories
  - **Tasks**:
    1. Add `index.ts` to `components/blog/`
    2. Add `index.ts` to `components/projects/`
    3. Add `index.ts` to `components/resume/`
    4. Add `index.ts` to `components/about/`
    5. Add `index.ts` to `components/home/`
    6. Add `index.ts` to `components/common/`

    - `lib/design-tokens.ts` (480 lines, 16 exports)
    - `lib/article.ts` (433 lines, 6 exports)
    - `lib/feeds.ts` (426 lines, 3 exports)
    - `lib/archive.ts` (423 lines, 6 exports)
  - **Impact**: Violates single-responsibility principle, harder to test and maintain
  - **Approach**: Split into logical subdirectories
  - **Tasks**:
    1. Create `lib/analytics/` with `fetching.ts`, `aggregations.ts`, `transformations.ts`
    2. Create `lib/metadata/` with `pages.ts`, `structured-data.ts`, `social.ts`
    3. Keep `lib/design-tokens.ts` as-is (configuration file)
    4. Consider splitting `lib/article.ts`, `lib/feeds.ts`, `lib/archive.ts` if needed
    5. Add barrel exports to new directories
    6. Update imports across codebase
  - **Expected Outcome**: Better code organization, easier to find and test specific functionality
  - **ROI**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Improved maintainability, easier onboarding

### Error Handling - DRY Principles

- [ ] **Phase 4.5: Consolidate error boundaries** (1-2 hours) 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY**
  - **Problem**: 4 separate error boundary implementations with similar patterns
  - **Files**: `error-boundary.tsx`, `contact-form-error-boundary.tsx`, `page-error-boundary.tsx`, `github-heatmap-error-boundary.tsx`
  - **Impact**: Duplicated logic, inconsistent error handling
  - **Approach**: Create base error boundary with customizable fallbacks
  - **Tasks**:
    1. Create `components/common/error-boundaries/BaseErrorBoundary.tsx`
    2. Create `withErrorBoundary.tsx` HOC for easy wrapping
    3. Refactor existing boundaries to extend base
    4. Add barrel export
    5. Update usage across codebase
  - **Expected Outcome**: DRY error handling, consistent user experience
  - **ROI**: ⭐⭐⭐ Reduces maintenance, ensures consistent error UX

### Style Organization

- [ ] **Phase 4.6: Consolidate CSS files** (30 minutes) 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY**
  - **Problem**: CSS split between `app/` and `styles/` directories
  - **Files**: `app/globals.css`, `app/print.css`, `styles/holo-card.css`
  - **Impact**: Inconsistent organization, harder to find styles
  - **Approach**: Move all CSS to `src/styles/`
  - **Tasks**:
    1. Create `src/styles/components/` directory
    2. Move `styles/holo-card.css` to `styles/components/`
    3. Move `app/print.css` to `styles/print.css`
    4. Keep `app/globals.css` (required by Next.js)
    5. Update import paths
  - **Expected Outcome**: All styles in one location (except globals)
  - **ROI**: ⭐⭐⭐ Better organization, easier to maintain

### Cleanup

- [ ] **Phase 4.7: Remove backup/disabled files** (15 minutes) 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY**
  - **Problem**: 10 backup files in source tree (`.disabled`, `.backup`, `.old`)
  - **Location**: `src/app/analytics/` directory
  - **Impact**: Clutter, confusion, potential security risk if deployed
  - **Tasks**:
    1. Review all `.disabled`, `.backup`, `.old` files
    2. Archive to `/archive/` outside source tree or delete
    3. Document any important learnings
  - **Expected Outcome**: Clean source tree, no confusion
  - **ROI**: ⭐⭐ Code hygiene

  - ✅ Bundle size monitoring: First Load < 150 kB, Main < 100 kB, Page < 50 kB
  - ✅ Created automated bundle check script with pass/warning/error status
  - ✅ Configured performance budgets in performance-budgets.json
  - ✅ Integrated Web Vitals reporter in root layout
  - ✅ Added npm scripts: perf:check, perf:analyze
  - ✅ Created comprehensive documentation in docs/performance/performance-monitoring.md
  - ✅ Created performance review log for weekly tracking
  - **Deliverables**:
    - `src/lib/web-vitals.ts` - Core Web Vitals tracking library
    - `src/components/web-vitals-reporter.tsx` - Client component
    - `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs` - Automated bundle monitoring
    - `performance-budgets.json` - Budget configuration
    - `docs/performance/performance-monitoring.md` - Complete strategy guide
    - `docs/operations/performance-review-log.md` - Weekly tracking
  - **Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Complete monitoring stack, proactive performance management
  - **Next Steps**: Deploy and establish baseline metrics, configure Vercel alerts

- [x] **Bot detection with Vercel BotID** (3 hours) ✅ **COMPLETED** (Nov 19, 2025)
  - ✅ Installed botid v1.5.10 library
  - ✅ Added initBotId() to instrumentation-client.ts with protected routes configuration
  - ✅ Wrapped next.config.ts with withBotId() for proxy rewrites
  - ✅ Created convenience re-export in src/lib/bot-detection.ts
  - ✅ Protected /api/contact (POST) route from bot traffic
  - ✅ Created comprehensive documentation in docs/security/bot-detection.md

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Getting Started

1. **Phase 1 & 2 Complete** ✅ - Foundation and performance work done
2. **Phase 3: Enhancement Mode** - Focus on data-driven improvements
3. **One enhancement at a time** - Validate with analytics before next item
4. **Content creation priority** - Work through editorial calendar
5. **Update done.md** - Move completed items with date and learnings

### Priority Decision Framework
Ask these questions before adding new items:

1. **Is it critical?** (compliance, security, accessibility) → 🚨 CRITICAL
2. **Does it prevent problems?** (monitoring, backups, testing) → 🔴 HIGH  
3. **Does it drive growth?** (SEO, performance, content) → 🟡 MEDIUM
4. **Is it data-validated?** (analytics show user need) → 🟢 LOW
5. **Is it speculative?** (no user request, no data) → ⚪ BACKLOG or REMOVE

### Before Starting Work
- [ ] Check accessibility impact (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Estimate effort realistically (add 25% buffer)
- [ ] Consider test coverage needs
- [ ] Plan documentation updates
- [ ] Review related components/systems

### Before Committing
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and fix errors

- [ ] Update blog post `updatedAt` for content changes
- [ ] Test in multiple browsers if UI changes
- [ ] Review Lighthouse scores for major UI changes
- [ ] Update documentation if behavior changes
- [ ] Move completed item to `done.md` with date

### Effort Estimates
- **30 min - 2 hours**: Quick wins, config changes, simple components
- **3-6 hours**: New features, API integrations, moderate refactoring  
- **8-12 hours**: Complex features, testing infrastructure, large refactors
- **2+ weeks**: Major projects - break down into smaller milestones

### ROI Indicators
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Must do** - High impact, prevents problems, saves time
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Should do** - Clear value, improves key metrics
- ⭐⭐⭐ **Nice to have** - Positive impact but not urgent
- ⭐⭐ **Low priority** - Marginal benefit, do when time permits
- ⭐ **Questionable** - Consider removing or deferring
