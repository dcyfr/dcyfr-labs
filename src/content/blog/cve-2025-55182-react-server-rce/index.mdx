<Alert type="critical">
**CRITICAL UPDATE (December 6, 2025):** Security researchers confirm **active exploitation in the wild**. CVE-2025-55182, now widely known as **"React2Shell,"** has been integrated into Mirai and other botnet exploitation toolkits. Nearly 50% of attacking IPs are newly registered infrastructure (December 2025). Post-exploitation activities include cryptocurrency mining, credential theft, and ransomware staging.
</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">
**Disclosure Notice:** This vulnerability was publicly disclosed on December 3, 2025. If you're running Next.js 14.3+, 15, or 16 with React Server Components, you should upgrade immediately, regardless of your hosting provider.
</Alert>

**TL;DR**:
- **What:** CVE-2025-55182 ("React2Shell") is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in React Server Components (RSC).
- **When:** Publicly disclosed December 3, 2025; active exploitation confirmed December 6, 2025.
- **Who:** Affects React 19.0.0 - 19.2.0 and Next.js ≥14.3.0-canary.77, all 15.x, all 16.x.
- **Why:** RCE allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on your server, access secrets, and pivot within your infrastructure.
- **How:** Upgrade immediately to React 19.0.1, 19.1.2, or 19.2.1+ and Next.js 15.0.5+ or 16.0.7+.

Today we witnessed defense in depth working exactly as intended. Within hours of `CVE-2025-55182` being disclosed, a critical remote code execution vulnerability in React Server Components, we received alerts from *two* different sources:

1. **Vercel's dashboard**, warning us that WAF rules were already protecting our production deployment
2. **[Dependabot PR #87](https://github.com/dcyfr/dcyfr-labs/pull/87)**, automatically upgrading Next.js from 16.0.6 to 16.0.7

![Vercel Dashboard Alert](/blog/cve-2025-55182-react-server-rce/assets/vercel-dashboard-warning.png)

This is what modern security infrastructure looks like: multiple layers working in concert. Vercel's WAF provided *immediate* protection before we could even review the PR, while Dependabot delivered the actual patch for permanent remediation.

In this post, we'll break down what `CVE-2025-55182` is, why it matters, how these layered defenses protected our app, and what you should do to secure your own projects.

## What Is CVE-2025-55182 (React2Shell)?

`CVE-2025-55182`, also known as **"React2Shell"** in the security community, is a **critical-severity vulnerability** affecting React Server Components (RSC). Under certain conditions, specially crafted requests can lead to **unintended remote code execution (RCE)** on the server.

The vulnerability exists in React 19's server-side rendering packages:

- `react-server-dom-parcel`
- `react-server-dom-webpack`
- `react-server-dom-turbopack`

For Next.js specifically, there's a related CVE: [CVE-2025-66478](https://nextjs.org/blog/CVE-2025-66478).

### Why This Matters

RCE vulnerabilities are among the most severe security issues. An attacker exploiting this could potentially:

- Execute arbitrary code on your server
- Access environment variables and secrets
- Pivot to other services in your infrastructure
- Exfiltrate sensitive data

This isn't a theoretical risk—it's actively exploited in the wild with confirmed botnet integration.

## Am I Affected?

If you're using React Server Components with any of these versions, you're affected:

| Package | Affected Versions | Fixed Versions |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| React | 19.0.0 - 19.2.0 | 19.0.1, 19.1.2, 19.2.1+ |
| Next.js | ≥14.3.0-canary.77, all 15.x, all 16.x | 15.0.5+, 16.0.7+ |

**Other affected frameworks:** Vite with RSC, Parcel, React Router (RSC), RedwoodSDK, Waku

**Quick check for Next.js projects:**

```bash
# Check your current versions
npm ls next react

# Or in your package.json
cat package.json | grep -E '"(next|react)"'
```

## How Vercel Beat the Bots

**Attack Chain Context:** Exploitation is fully automated, progressing from scanner identification to payload deployment in under 10 seconds. Attackers use PowerShell arithmetic validation (`powershell -c "40138*41979"`), encoded payloads, AMSI bypasses, then deploy cryptocurrency miners, backdoors, and credential harvesters.

Here's what makes this disclosure interesting from a DevSecOps perspective: **Vercel's platform detected and mitigated this vulnerability before Dependabot could even create a PR.**

The Timeline
---

The disclosure and exploitation unfolded rapidly:

1. **December 3, 2025 - Pre-disclosure**: Vercel coordinates with the React team, develops WAF rules
2. **December 3, 2025 - Public disclosure**: CVE-2025-55182 and CVE-2025-66478 are published
3. **December 3, 2025 - Immediate WAF deployment**: Vercel automatically deploys protection rules
4. **December 3, 2025 - 20:49 UTC - Same-day Dependabot PR**: [PR #87](https://github.com/dcyfr/dcyfr-labs/pull/87) arrives
5. **December 4, 2025 - 21:04 UTC**: Security researchers confirm multiple public proof-of-concept exploits
6. **December 4, 2025 - Exploitation begins**: Active scanning and exploitation attempts detected globally
7. **December 5, 2025 - 23:44 UTC**: Vercel partners with HackerOne for responsible disclosure (\$25k-\$50k bounties)
8. **December 6, 2025 - 06:29 UTC**: Vercel releases `npx fix-react2shell-next` automated fix tool
9. **December 6, 2025 - Deployment blocking**: Vercel begins blocking NEW deployments of vulnerable Next.js versions

Both systems worked, but with different roles and limitations:

- **Vercel's WAF**: Defense-in-depth layer (mitigation, not complete protection)
- **Dependabot**: Same-day patch delivery (complete remediation)

### Vercel's Approach

Vercel coordinated with the React team pre-disclosure, deployed WAF rules automatically to all projects, and continuously improved protections as bypass variants emerged. They released automated fix tooling (`npx fix-react2shell-next`) and began blocking new vulnerable deployments.

> "We have created new WAF rules to address this vulnerability and deployed them to Vercel WAF that will automatically and at no cost protect all projects hosted on Vercel."
> — Jimour Lai, Vercel Security Engineer

**Important WAF Limitations:** Vercel acknowledges that "WAF rules are one layer of defense but can never guarantee 100% coverage." As new exploit variants emerged, Vercel identified and patched WAF bypasses, but **upgrading remains the only complete fix.**

This means that while the WAF provided valuable defense-in-depth, our production deployment wasn't truly secure until we merged the upgrade. The WAF bought us time and reduced risk, but it wasn't a substitute for patching.

### The Broader Impact

Vercel also worked with the React team to provide recommendations to major WAF and CDN providers. This collaborative approach helps protect the broader ecosystem, not just Vercel customers.

## How to Fix It

Even with WAF protection, **you should still upgrade**. WAF rules are a mitigation, not a permanent fix.

### For Next.js Projects

```bash
# Upgrade to the latest patched version
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

# Or specify exact versions
npm install next@16.0.7 react@19.2.1 react-dom@19.2.1
```

### Verify Your Upgrade

After upgrading, confirm the versions:

```bash
npm ls next react react-dom
```

You should see versions at or above the patched releases listed in the table above.

### For Other RSC Frameworks

Check your framework's documentation for specific upgrade instructions. The underlying fix is in React itself, so ensure you're on React 19.0.1, 19.1.2, or 19.2.1+.

## Detection & Response

If you suspect your application may have been compromised, here's how to investigate:

### Signs of Compromise

Monitor your systems for these indicators:

1. **Unusual POST requests** with patterns like:
   - `_prefix`, `_chunks`, `_formData` in request bodies
   - Large encoded payloads
   - Requests to uncommon RSC endpoints

2. **PowerShell execution** (Windows servers):
   - Commands with `-enc` or `-EncodedCommand` flags
   - Base64-encoded command parameters
   - Arithmetic validation commands (e.g., `powershell -c "40138*41979"`)

3. **Windows Event Logs** (Event ID 4104 - PowerShell Script Block Logging):
   - AMSI bypass attempts containing strings like:
     - `System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils`
     - `amsiInitFailed`
     - Reflection-based attacks

4. **Network indicators**:
   - Outbound connections to unusual IPs or domains
   - DNS exfiltration attempts (`ceye.io`, `dnslog.cn`, etc.)
   - Cryptocurrency mining pool connections (C3Pool, etc.)

5. **Function timeouts** (weak indicator):
   - Unusual increases in serverless function execution times
   - Note: This alone is NOT definitive evidence

### Detection Code Samples

#### PowerShell Logging Query (Windows Event Log)

```powershell
# Search for AMSI bypass attempts in PowerShell logs
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational'
    Id=4104
} | Where-Object {
    $_.Message -match 'amsiInitFailed' -or
    $_.Message -match 'AmsiUtils' -or
    $_.Message -match 'System.Management.Automation'
} | Select-Object TimeCreated, Message | Format-List
```

#### Check for Encoded PowerShell Commands

```powershell
# Alert on suspicious encoded PowerShell with download patterns
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational'
    Id=4104
} | Where-Object {
    $_.Message -match '-enc' -and
    ($_.Message -match 'DownloadString' -or $_.Message -match 'IEX')
} | Select-Object TimeCreated, Message
```

#### Analyze Application Logs (Next.js/Node.js)

```bash
# Search for unusual POST patterns in application logs
grep -E 'POST.*(_prefix|_chunks|_formData)' /var/log/app/*.log

# Check for PowerShell execution in function logs
grep -iE 'powershell|cmd\.exe|/bin/sh' /var/log/app/*.log

# Look for base64 patterns in request bodies
grep -E 'base64|[A-Za-z0-9+/]{50,}=' /var/log/app/*.log
```

#### Network Traffic Analysis

```bash
# Check for connections to known mining pools or exfiltration services
netstat -an | grep -E '(3333|4444|5555|8080|8443)'

# Review DNS queries for exfiltration domains
tcpdump -i any -n 'udp port 53' | grep -E '(ceye\.io|dnslog\.cn)'
```

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify your version** (for Vercel customers):
   - Open browser console on your production site
   - Run: `next.version`
   - Or check Vercel dashboard for vulnerability banner

2. **Review recent logs** for the patterns above:
   - Application logs
   - WAF logs (if available)
   - System event logs
   - Network traffic logs

3. **Block known malicious IPs**:
   - Use [GreyNoise blocklists](https://viz.greynoise.io/query/tags:%22React%20Server%20Components%20Unsafe%20Deserialization%20CVE-2025-55182%20RCE%20Attempt%22)
   - Add IP filtering at CDN/WAF layer

4. **Upgrade immediately**:
   ```bash
   # Use Vercel's automated fix tool (recommended)
   npx fix-react2shell-next
   
   # Or manual upgrade
   npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
   ```

5. **Monitor continuously**:
   - Enable PowerShell Script Block Logging (Windows)
   - Increase application log verbosity temporarily
   - Set up alerts for the detection patterns above

### For Vercel Customers

Vercel provides additional detection assistance:

- **Dashboard banner**: Check for vulnerability alerts in your Vercel dashboard
- **WAF logs**: Review WAF validation traffic for spikes
- **Deployment blocking**: New vulnerable deployments are automatically blocked

Remember: **WAF protection is defense-in-depth, not a complete fix.** Even if you see no exploitation attempts, upgrade immediately.

## What This Means for RSC Security

React Server Components represent a significant architectural shift. They blur the line between client and server code, which creates new attack surfaces that didn't exist in traditional client-side React.

This vulnerability is a reminder that:

1. **Server-side code needs server-side security thinking.** RSC isn't "just React", it's React running in a privileged environment.

2. **Framework-level protections matter.** Vercel's ability to deploy WAF rules across their platform demonstrates the value of managed infrastructure.

3. **The disclosure process is evolving.** Coordinated disclosure with platform providers can protect users faster than traditional CVE→Dependabot→CI workflows.

## What We Did: Dependabot's PR

After reviewing [PR #87](https://github.com/dcyfr/dcyfr-labs/pull/87), we merged Dependabot's upgrade from Next.js 16.0.6 to 16.0.7. Dependabot linked to the CVE, our CI validated the upgrade, and we deployed. Vercel's WAF bought us time while Dependabot delivered the permanent fix—we weren't scrambling, just approving the change.

### For Projects Without Dependabot

If you're not using Dependabot or Renovate, here's how to upgrade manually:

```bash
# Upgrade to the latest patched version
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

# Or specify exact versions
npm install next@16.0.7 react@19.2.1 react-dom@19.2.1
```

Verify your upgrade:

```bash
npm ls next react react-dom
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details open>
<summary>How do I know if my application was exploited?</summary>

Look for these indicators:

1. **Log evidence**: Unusual POST requests, PowerShell execution, encoded commands
2. **System behavior**: Unexpected CPU usage (cryptomining), new processes, unauthorized network connections
3. **Windows Event Logs**: Event ID 4104 showing AMSI bypass attempts
4. **Network traffic**: Connections to mining pools (port 3333, 4444), DNS exfiltration domains

If you find evidence, assume compromise and:
- Rotate all secrets and credentials immediately
- Audit all environment variables and .env files
- Review AWS/cloud IAM access logs for lateral movement
- Consider bringing in incident response professionals

**Important**: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. If you were vulnerable, upgrade and monitor even if you see no signs of compromise.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is Vercel's WAF protection enough? Do I still need to upgrade?</summary>

**No, WAF protection alone is not sufficient. You must upgrade.**

Here's why:

- **WAF cannot guarantee 100% coverage**: Vercel explicitly states this in their guidance
- **Bypass variants exist**: Multiple WAF bypass techniques have been identified and patched
- **New variants emerging**: Attackers continuously develop new exploitation methods
- **Defense-in-depth principle**: WAF is one layer, not the solution

Think of the WAF as a seatbelt—it improves safety but doesn't eliminate risk. **Upgrading is fixing the brakes.**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Should I test public proof-of-concept exploits on my application?</summary>

**Absolutely not.** Here's why:

1. **Legal risk**: Running exploits, even against your own infrastructure, may violate terms of service or regulations
2. **Production impact**: POC exploits can cause unintended damage or instability
3. **False security**: Successfully blocking a known POC doesn't mean you're safe from variants
4. **Logging concerns**: You'll create suspicious log entries that may trigger security alerts

Instead:
- **Verify your version numbers** using `npm ls next react`
- **Check Vercel dashboard** for vulnerability indicators
- **Review logs** for the detection patterns provided above
- **Upgrade immediately** rather than testing

If you need to validate security controls, work with professional penetration testers in a controlled non-production environment.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What if I can't upgrade immediately?</summary>

If upgrading is not immediately possible:

1. **For Vercel customers**:
   - WAF provides some protection but is not complete
   - Monitor dashboard for exploitation attempts
   - Plan upgrade as highest priority

2. **For non-Vercel hosting**:
   - Deploy a WAF if available (Cloudflare, AWS WAF, etc.)
   - Contact your hosting provider for protection options
   - **Strongly consider taking affected applications offline** until patched

3. **Temporary mitigations** (defense-in-depth, NOT complete protection):
   - Block requests with suspicious patterns at reverse proxy/load balancer
   - Implement strict input validation
   - Isolate affected applications from critical infrastructure
   - Monitor aggressively using detection patterns above

4. **Make upgrading happen**:
   - Treat this as a critical incident
   - Fast-track change approval processes
   - Consider hotfix deployment procedures
   - Allocate emergency resources

**Reality check**: Active botnet exploitation means your attack surface is being probed constantly. Every hour of delay increases risk.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does this affect Server Actions or only Server Components?</summary>

The vulnerability affects **React Server Components (RSC)** broadly, which includes:

- Server Components themselves
- Server Actions (which use RSC infrastructure)
- Any RSC-based rendering pipeline

If you're using Next.js App Router (Next.js 13+), you're using RSC and are potentially affected. The vulnerability is in React's server-side rendering packages, not specific features.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What about other frameworks besides Next.js?</summary>

Yes, any framework using React Server Components is affected:

- **Vite with RSC**
- **Parcel with RSC**
- **React Router with RSC**
- **RedwoodSDK**
- **Waku**
- Any custom RSC implementation

Check your framework's security advisories and upgrade React to patched versions (19.0.1, 19.1.2, or 19.2.1+).

</details>

<details>
<summary>How long will attackers actively exploit this?</summary>

**Expect long-term exploitation activity.** Here's the typical pattern:

- **Week 1-2** (now): Opportunistic mass scanning, botnet integration
- **Month 1-3**: Continued automated exploitation, targeting unpatched systems
- **Month 3-12**: Integration into standard botnet toolkits, persistent background scanning
- **Year 1+**: Long-tail exploitation of abandoned or unmaintained applications

CVEs like this become part of the permanent threat landscape. The scanning won't stop—vulnerable systems will be found and exploited indefinitely.

</details>

**This is why upgrading is non-negotiable.**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Upgrade immediately—this is under active exploitation**: Botnet integration confirmed, mass scanning ongoing, post-exploitation includes cryptomining and ransomware staging
2. **Use Vercel's fix tool for fastest remediation**: `npx fix-react2shell-next` automates the upgrade process
3. **WAF protection is defense-in-depth, not a complete fix**: WAF cannot guarantee 100% coverage; bypasses exist and new variants emerge
4. **Monitor for compromise using the detection patterns**: PowerShell Event ID 4104, encoded commands, AMSI bypasses, unusual network connections
5. **Enable Dependabot security updates**: Same-day PRs for critical vulnerabilities are invaluable (when you actually merge them)
6. **RSC introduces server-side attack surfaces**: React Server Components blur client/server boundaries, creating new security considerations
7. **Expect long-term exploitation**: This vulnerability will be part of the threat landscape indefinitely—unpatched systems will be found
8. **Don't test POCs on production**: Use version checks and log analysis instead of running exploits

## Lessons Learned

This incident highlights several important lessons for DevSecOps teams:
- **Defense in depth works**: Vercel's WAF and Dependabot provided layered protection
- **Automated tooling is essential**: Automated fix tools and dependency management speed remediation
- **Proactive monitoring is critical**: Detection patterns help identify potential compromises quickly
- **Collaboration matters**: Coordinated disclosure with platform providers enhances ecosystem security
