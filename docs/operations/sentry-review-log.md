2. CYBERDREW-DEV-P - Import error: `CONTAINER_PADDING` - Fixed in commit
3. CYBERDREW-DEV-6 - Import error: `SITE_TITLE` - Fixed in commit
4. CYBERDREW-DEV-N - `/team/page` export error - Page intentionally removed
5. CYBERDREW-DEV-7 - Mermaid CSS variable error - Using built-in themes (fixed)
6. CYBERDREW-DEV-M - Same as CYBERDREW-DEV-7
7. CYBERDREW-DEV-4 - Connection error: EPIPE - Now handled gracefully
8. CYBERDREW-DEV-5 - Connection error: ECONNRESET - Now handled gracefully
9. CYBERDREW-DEV-9 - CSP violation: Perplexity AI extension - Expected behavior

**Open Issues (3):**

1. **CYBERDREW-DEV-9** - CSP violations from browser extensions
   - Status: Monitoring (expected behavior)
   - Action: Weekly review for patterns
   - Documentation: `docs/security/csp-monitoring.md`

2. **Connection Errors** - EPIPE, ECONNRESET, ECONNABORTED
   - Status: Handled gracefully
   - Action: Log at debug level, not as errors
   - Implementation: `src/lib/error-handler.ts`

3. **Rate Limiting Edge Cases**
   - Status: Monitoring for patterns
   - Action: No immediate action required

### Infrastructure Improvements

1. ✅ Created centralized error handler (`src/lib/error-handler.ts`)
2. ✅ Implemented graceful connection error handling
3. ✅ Added error severity classification
4. ✅ Created 18 unit tests for error handling
5. ✅ Updated all API routes with proper error handling
6. ✅ Documented CSP monitoring process

### Action Items

- [x] Create error monitoring strategy document
- [x] Define severity levels and SLAs
- [x] Document common error patterns
- [x] Configure alert guidelines
- [ ] Set up Sentry alert rules (requires dashboard access)
- [ ] Configure email notifications
- [ ] Test alert system

### Notes

Initial baseline established. All code-related errors have been resolved. Infrastructure monitoring is now optimized to distinguish between expected client disconnections and actual errors. CSP violations from third-party extensions are expected and documented.

**Next Review:** 2025-11-25 (Monday)
