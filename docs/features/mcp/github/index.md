**Q: Is it safe?**
A: Yes - token stored securely by VS Code, not visible in files.

**Q: What if I don't want GitHub MCP?**
A: It's optional. Set `"disabled": true` in mcp.json.

**Q: Can I change what capabilities are available?**
A: Yes - modify toolsets in config. See `docs/mcp/github/implementation.md`.

**Q: What's the difference between the 4 documents?**
A: See "Documents" section above or use the decision tree at top.
