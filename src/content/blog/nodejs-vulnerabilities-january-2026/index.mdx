---

On January 13, 2026, the Node.js project released security patches addressing:

- **3 HIGH severity** vulnerabilities (buffer memory leak, symlink bypass, HTTP/2 DoS)
- **4 MEDIUM severity** vulnerabilities (AsyncLocalStorage crashes, TLS memory leak, UDS bypass, TLS callback DoS)
- **1 LOW severity** vulnerability (timestamp permissions bypass)

### Permissions Model Scope

**Important context:** Three CVEs (CVE-2025-55130, CVE-2026-21636, CVE-2025-55132) **only affect users of Node.js's experimental permission model** (`--experimental-permission` or `--permission` flags).

This feature, introduced in Node.js v20[^1], has **limited production adoption**. Most Node.js deployments do NOT use the permissions model.

**Quick check:** If you don't explicitly pass `--permission`, `--allow-fs-read`, `--allow-fs-write`, or `--allow-net` flags when starting Node.js, these three CVEs don't apply to your deployment.

**If you do use the permissions model:** These are **critical bypasses** that break your security boundaries. Upgrade immediately.

**Patched Versions:**

| Release Line            | Patched Version | Release Notes                                                 |

## HIGH Severity Vulnerabilities

### CVE-2025-55131: Buffer Memory Leak via Race Condition

**Severity:** <SeverityLabel severity="HIGH" />  
**CVE ID:** <CVELink cve="CVE-2025-55131" />  
**Affected Versions:** 20.x, 22.x, 24.x, 25.x  
**Reporter:** Nikita Skovoroda

A flaw in Node.js buffer allocation logic can expose uninitialized memory when allocations are interrupted while using the `vm` module with the timeout option. Under specific timing conditions, buffers allocated with `Buffer.alloc()` and <GlossaryTooltip term="TypedArray" definition="JavaScript typed arrays provide a mechanism for accessing raw binary data - includes Uint8Array, Int32Array, Float64Array, and others">TypedArray</GlossaryTooltip> instances like `Uint8Array` may contain leftover data from previous operations.

**Impact:**

This vulnerability allows in-process secrets like tokens, passwords, or API keys to leak, potentially causing data corruption. While exploitation typically requires precise timing or in-process code execution, it becomes remotely exploitable when untrusted input influences workload and timeouts.

**Example Risk Scenario:**

```typescript
import { runInNewContext } from 'vm';

// Previous operation stored sensitive data
const sensitiveBuffer = Buffer.alloc(1024);
sensitiveBuffer.write('SECRET_API_KEY_xyz123');

// Later, with vm timeout, race condition can occur
const result = runInNewContext('Buffer.alloc(1024)', {}, { timeout: 100 });
// result may contain: "SECRET_API_KEY_xyz123" from previous operation
```

**Mitigation:** Upgrade to patched versions. Avoid using `vm` module with untrusted input and timeout options in security-sensitive contexts.

---

### CVE-2025-55130: File System Permissions Bypass via Symlinks

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Affected Versions:** 20.x, 22.x, 24.x, 25.x (permissions model users)  
**Reporter:** natann  
**Fix By:** RafaelGSS

A flaw in Node.js's Permissions model allows attackers to bypass `--allow-fs-read` and `--allow-fs-write` restrictions using crafted relative symlink paths. By chaining directories and symlinks, a script granted access only to the current directory can escape the allowed path and read sensitive files.

**Impact:**

This breaks the expected isolation guarantees and enables arbitrary file read/write, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Attack Pattern:**

```bash
# Application started with restricted permissions
node --experimental-permission --allow-fs-read=/app/data ./app.js

# Attacker creates symlink chain to escape /app/data
# symlink: /app/data/escape -> ../../../etc/passwd
# Script can now read /etc/passwd despite restrictions
```

**Who Is Affected:**

Only users of the Node.js permission model (`--experimental-permission` or `--permission` flags) are affected. If you're not using these flags, this CVE does not apply to your deployments.

**Mitigation:** Upgrade to patched versions. Review symlink handling in permission-restricted environments.

---

### CVE-2025-59465: HTTP/2 Server Crash via Malformed HEADERS

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Affected Versions:** 20.x, 22.x, 24.x, 25.x  
**Reporter:** dantt  
**Fix By:** RafaelGSS

A malformed <GlossaryTooltip term="HTTP/2" definition="HTTP/2 - the second major version of the HTTP network protocol, featuring multiplexing, header compression, and server push capabilities">HTTP/2</GlossaryTooltip> HEADERS frame with oversized, invalid <GlossaryTooltip term="HPACK" definition="HPACK - HTTP/2 header compression format that uses Huffman coding and dynamic table to reduce header overhead">HPACK</GlossaryTooltip> data can cause Node.js to crash by triggering an unhandled `TLSSocket` error (`ECONNRESET`). Instead of safely closing the connection, the process crashes, enabling remote denial of service.

**Impact:**

This vulnerability primarily affects applications that do not attach explicit error handlers to secure sockets. A remote attacker can crash your entire Node.js process with a single malformed request.

**Vulnerable Pattern:**

```typescript
// Default HTTP/2 server - NO explicit error handlers
import { createSecureServer } from 'http2';

const server = createSecureServer({
  key: privateKey,
  cert: certificate,
});

server.on('stream', (stream, headers) => {
  // Handle request
});

server.listen(443);
// Attacker sends malformed HEADERS frame -> Process crashes
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**

```typescript
// Add explicit error handlers to prevent crashes
server.on('secureConnection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error(
      '<GlossaryTooltip term="TLS Socket Error" definition="TLS Socket Error - errors occurring during secure socket communication, commonly including connection resets, handshake failures, and protocol violations that can crash servers if unhandled">TLS Socket Error</GlossaryTooltip>:',
      err.message
    );
    // Gracefully close instead of crashing
    socket.destroy();
  });
});
```

**Who Is Affected:**

Any Node.js application using HTTP/2 without explicit TLS socket error handlers. This includes many Next.js, Fastify, and custom HTTP/2 deployments.

## MEDIUM Severity Vulnerabilities

### CVE-2025-59466: AsyncLocalStorage Stack Overflow Crashes

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Affected Versions:** 20.x, 22.x, 24.x, 25.x  
**Reporter:** Andrew MacPherson (AndrewMohawk), aaron_vercel  
**Fix By:** mcollina

A bug in Node.js error handling causes "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors to become uncatchable when `async_hooks.createHook()` is enabled. Instead of reaching `process.on('uncaughtException')`, the process terminates immediately, making the crash unrecoverable.

**Why This Matters:**

This vulnerability silently affects a massive portion of the Node.js ecosystem because:

- **React Server Components** use <GlossaryTooltip term="AsyncLocalStorage" definition="AsyncLocalStorage - a Node.js API providing context-aware storage across asynchronous operations, allowing data to persist through async call chains without explicit parameter passing">AsyncLocalStorage</GlossaryTooltip> internally
- **Next.js** uses AsyncLocalStorage for request context tracking (cookies, headers)[^4]
- **Every major APM tool** (Datadog[^5], New Relic[^6], Dynatrace, Elastic APM, OpenTelemetry[^7]) uses AsyncLocalStorage or `async_hooks.createHook()` to trace requests

Applications whose recursion depth is controlled by unsanitized input become vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.

**Example Vulnerable Pattern:**

```typescript
// API route processing deeply nested user input
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const data = await request.json();

  // If data is deeply nested (1000+ levels), stack overflow occurs
  // With AsyncLocalStorage active, error bypasses all handlers
  // Process crashes immediately - no logging, no recovery
  const result = processNestedData(data);

  return Response.json(result);
}
```

**Important Caveat:**

The Node.js patch improves recoverability in one edge case, but the documentation explicitly states:

> "Recovery from space exhaustion is unspecified, best-effort behavior and is not a reliable basis for availability or security."

**Recommendation:** Don't rely on catching stack overflow errors. Prevent them by validating input depth and bounding recursion.

**Important for Node.js v24+ users:** Node.js v24 fundamentally changed AsyncLocalStorage's implementation—it no longer uses `async_hooks.createHook()` internally[^8]. This means:

- **React Server Components: NOT affected on Node.js v24+**
- **Next.js (cookies, headers, etc.): NOT affected on Node.js v24+**
- **APM tools using only AsyncLocalStorage: NOT affected on Node.js v24+**
- **APM tools directly using `async_hooks.createHook()`: Still affected on all versions**

**If you're running Node.js v24.13.0+**, CVE-2025-59466 is primarily a concern if you:

1. Use APM tools that directly call `async_hooks.createHook()` (check vendor documentation)
2. Have custom code using `async_hooks.createHook()`
3. Run Node.js v20-v23 (where the vulnerability fully applies)

**Bottom line:** The risk profile for Next.js applications is significantly different between Node.js v20-v23 (high risk) and v24+ (lower risk). Upgrade regardless, but understand the context.

**Further Reading:** Node.js published a detailed companion blog post: [Mitigating Denial-of-Service Vulnerability from Unrecoverable Stack Space Exhaustion for React, Next.js, and APM Users](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/january-2026-dos-mitigation-async-hooks)

### CVE-2025-59464: TLS Certificate Memory Leak

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Affected Versions:** 20.x, 22.x, 24.x  
**Reporter:** giant_anteater  
**Fix By:** RafaelGSS

A memory leak in Node.js's OpenSSL integration occurs when converting X.509 certificate fields to UTF-8 without freeing the allocated buffer. When applications call `socket.getPeerCertificate(true)`, each certificate field leaks memory.

**Impact:**

Remote clients can trigger steady memory growth through repeated TLS connections. Over time, this leads to resource exhaustion and denial of service.

**Affected Pattern:**

```typescript
// TLS server processing client certificates
server.on('secureConnection', (socket) => {
  // Each call leaks memory
  const cert = socket.getPeerCertificate(true);
  // Memory never freed for certificate fields
});
```

**Who Is Affected:**

Applications that process TLS client certificates, particularly <GlossaryTooltip term="mTLS" definition="mTLS (Mutual TLS) - a security protocol requiring both client and server to authenticate each other using X.509 certificates, commonly used for zero-trust architectures and service-to-service authentication">mutual TLS (mTLS)</GlossaryTooltip> implementations and certificate-based authentication systems.

### CVE-2026-21636: Unix Domain Socket Permissions Bypass

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Affected Versions:** v25.x only  
**Reporter:** mufeedvh  
**Fix By:** RafaelGSS

A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows Unix Domain Socket (UDS) connections to bypass network restrictions when `--permission` is enabled. Even without `--allow-net`, attacker-controlled inputs (such as URLs or socketPath options) can connect to arbitrary local sockets via `net`, `tls`, or `undici/fetch`.

**Impact:**

This breaks the intended security boundary of the permission model and enables access to privileged local services, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data exposure, or local code execution.

**Note:** Network permissions (`--allow-net`) are still in the experimental phase.

**Who Is Affected:**

Only users of the Node.js permission model on version v25.x. If you're using v20, v22, or v24, or not using the permission model, this CVE does not apply.

---

### CVE-2026-21637: TLS PSK/ALPN Callback DoS

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Affected Versions:** All versions using PSK or ALPN callbacks  
**Reporter:** 0xmaxhax  
**Fix By:** mcollina

A flaw in Node.js TLS error handling allows remote attackers to crash or exhaust resources of a TLS server when `pskCallback` or `ALPNCallback` are in use. Synchronous exceptions thrown during these callbacks bypass standard TLS error handling paths (`tlsClientError` and `error`).

**Impact:**

This causes either immediate process termination or silent file descriptor leaks that eventually lead to denial of service. Because these callbacks process attacker-controlled input during the TLS handshake, a remote client can repeatedly trigger the issue.

**Who Is Affected:**

TLS servers using Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication or Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) callbacks that may throw exceptions.

---

## LOW Severity Vulnerability

### CVE-2025-55132: fs.futimes() Permissions Bypass

**Severity:** LOW  
**Affected Versions:** 20.x, 22.x, 24.x, 25.x (permissions model users)  
**Reporter:** oriotie  
**Fix By:** RafaelGSS

A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows a file's access and modification timestamps to be changed via `futimes()` even when the process has only read permissions. Unlike `utimes()`, `futimes()` does not apply the expected write-permission checks.

**Impact:**

File metadata can be modified in read-only directories. This behavior could be used to alter timestamps in ways that obscure activity, reducing the reliability of logs and audit trails.

**Who Is Affected:**

Only users of the Node.js permission model. Low impact for most deployments.

## Who Should Upgrade?

<CollapsibleSection
  id="nextjs-react-developers"
  title="Next.js and React Developers"
  defaultExpanded={true}
>

**You are affected if:**

- You use Next.js 13+ with App Router (uses `AsyncLocalStorage` internally)
- You use React Server Components
- You use `cookies()`, `headers()`, or other Next.js request context APIs

**Critical CVEs for you:**

- **CVE-2025-59466** (AsyncLocalStorage crashes) - Stack overflow errors in your API routes can crash your entire application
- **CVE-2025-59465** (HTTP/2 DoS) - If serving HTTP/2 traffic, malformed requests can crash your server

**Recommended Action:**

```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node --version

# Upgrade to patched version
nvm install 24.13.0  # or 22.22.0, 20.20.0

# Create version pinning file
echo "24.13.0" > .nvmrc
```

**Additional Mitigation:**

Validate input depth in API routes to prevent stack overflow:

```typescript
const MAX_DEPTH = 10;

function validateDepth(obj: unknown, depth = 0): boolean {
  if (depth > MAX_DEPTH) return false;
  if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null) return true;

  return Object.values(obj).every((v) => validateDepth(v, depth + 1));
}
```

</CollapsibleSection>

<CollapsibleSection
  id="apm-users"
  title="APM Tool Users (Datadog, New Relic, OpenTelemetry)"
  defaultExpanded={false}
>

**You are affected if:**

- You use any Application Performance Monitoring tool
- You have `require('dd-trace')`, `require('newrelic')`, or similar APM initialization
- You use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

**Why APM makes CVE-2025-59466 worse:**

APM tools use `async_hooks.createHook()` to trace requests across async boundaries. The moment you import an APM package, your application has `async_hooks` enabled, making stack overflow errors uncatchable.

The irony: The tools you install to monitor crashes can make a category of crashes behave differently.

**Recommended Action:**

1. Upgrade Node.js to patched versions immediately
2. Review recursive functions in your codebase
3. Add depth limits to any user-input-driven recursion

</CollapsibleSection>

<CollapsibleSection
  id="permissions-model-users"
  title="Permissions Model Users"
  defaultExpanded={false}
>

**You are affected if:**

- You use `--experimental-permission` or `--permission` flags
- You use `--allow-fs-read`, `--allow-fs-write`, or `--allow-net` flags

**Critical CVEs for you:**

- **CVE-2025-55130** (Symlink bypass) - Attackers can escape file system restrictions
- **CVE-2026-21636** (UDS bypass) - v25 only, network restrictions bypassed
- **CVE-2025-55132** (futimes bypass) - Timestamp modification in read-only directories

**Recommended Action:**

Upgrade immediately. The permissions model's security guarantees are broken until patched.

</CollapsibleSection>

<CollapsibleSection
  id="tls-server-operators"
  title="TLS Server Operators"
  defaultExpanded={false}
>

**You are affected if:**

- You run HTTP/2 servers with TLS
- You use TLS client certificate authentication (mTLS)
- You use Pre-Shared Key (PSK) or ALPN callbacks

**Critical CVEs for you:**

- **CVE-2025-59465** (HTTP/2 DoS) - Malformed frames crash servers
- **CVE-2025-59464** (TLS memory leak) - Certificate processing leaks memory
- **CVE-2026-21637** (Callback DoS) - PSK/ALPN exceptions cause crashes

**Recommended Action:**

1. Upgrade Node.js immediately
2. Add explicit error handlers to TLS sockets
3. Monitor memory usage for TLS-heavy workloads

</CollapsibleSection>

## How to Upgrade

### Using nvm (Node Version Manager)

```bash
# Install the patched version for your release line
nvm install 24.13.0  # LTS (recommended)
nvm install 22.22.0  # Previous LTS
nvm install 20.20.0  # Maintenance LTS
nvm install 25.3.0   # Current

# Verify installation
node --version
# v24.13.0

# Set as default
nvm alias default 24.13.0

# Create version pinning file for your project
echo "24.13.0" > .nvmrc
echo "24.13.0" > .node-version  # For other version managers
```

### Using Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade node
node --version
```

### Verifying the Upgrade

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version
# Should show: v20.20.0, v22.22.0, v24.13.0, or v25.3.0

# Verify npm is functional
npm --version

# Run your test suite
npm test
```

### CI/CD Considerations

Update your GitHub Actions workflows to use version pinning:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version-file: '.nvmrc' # Use version from .nvmrc file
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Upgrade immediately** - All active Node.js release lines (20.x, 22.x, 24.x, 25.x) are affected by at least 6 of the 8 CVEs

2. **HTTP/2 servers need error handlers** - CVE-2025-59465 can crash servers that lack explicit TLS socket error handling

3. **AsyncLocalStorage affects most modern apps** - If you use Next.js, React Server Components, or any APM tool, CVE-2025-59466 applies to you

4. **Prevent stack overflow, don't catch it** - Input validation and recursion depth limits are more reliable than error handling

5. **Permission model users: patch urgently** - Multiple CVEs break file system and network isolation guarantees

6. **Pin your Node.js version** - Use `.nvmrc` and `.node-version` files to ensure consistent versions across development and CI/CD

7. **Subscribe to security notifications** - Join the [nodejs-sec mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nodejs-sec) for future advisories
