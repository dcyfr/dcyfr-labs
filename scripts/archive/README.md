# Archived Scripts

This directory contains one-time utility scripts that were used for debugging or migrations but are no longer actively needed.

## Scripts

### Debug Scripts
- **debug-streak-gap.mjs** - Debug script for GitHub contribution streak calculation
- **debug-streak-gap-2.mjs** - Scenario 2 debug for streak gaps

### Migration Scripts
- **migrate-redis-keys-to-ids.mjs** - One-time migration from slug-based to ID-based Redis keys
- **migrate-views.mjs** - One-time migration for blog post view counts after slug changes

These scripts are retained for historical reference but should not be needed for normal development or deployment workflows.
