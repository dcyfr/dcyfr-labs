## 🔵 BACKLOG (Low Priority or Speculative)

### Infrastructure & Reliability

- [ ] **Backup & Disaster Recovery Plan** (2 hours)
- [ ] **GitHub Actions CI Improvements** (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Automated Performance Regression Tests** (3-4 hours)

### Future Features: Sponsor Dashboard & Tracking

**Current Status:** Public invite code display implemented at `/sponsors` and `/invites`. Phase 2 backlogged pending sponsor validation.

#### Phase 2: Tracking & Analytics (11-16 hours total)

- [ ] **API Tracking Endpoints** (2-3 hours)
  - `POST /api/invites/track` - Track invite code usage
  - Follow `/api/views` pattern with anti-spam protection
  - Session deduplication (24-hour window)
  - Rate limiting (5 requests/minute per IP)

- [ ] **Inngest Background Jobs** (2-3 hours)
  - `trackInviteCodeUse` - Increment usage counters
  - `handleInviteMilestone` - Detect 100/500/1000 uses
  - Vercel Analytics integration

- [ ] **Sponsor Authentication** (3-4 hours)
  - API key-based access (`SPONSOR_API_KEY` env var)
  - Per-sponsor tokens stored in Redis
  - `GET /api/invites/stats` - Protected stats endpoint

- [ ] **Sponsor Dashboard UI** (3-4 hours)

  - Display stats (uses, conversions, trending)
  - Chart visualization
  - Real-time updates via API polling

- [ ] **Privacy & Compliance** (1-2 hours)
  - IP address anonymization (hash only)
  - Session data TTL (30-90 days)
  - GDPR-compliant aggregate reporting

**Priority:** Low (no validated sponsor need yet)

### UI/UX Enhancements

- [ ] **Expandable FAB with Quick Actions Menu** (4-5 hours)
  - **Concept:** Single floating action button → expands into radial action nodes
  - **Actions:** Filter, Search, Clear All, Bookmarks, Layout Toggle
  - **Animation:** Smooth cascade or radial reveal using Framer Motion
  - **Mobile First:** Position bottom-right, gesture-friendly
  - **Implementation Options:**
    1. Radial menu - actions positioned in circle around FAB
    2. Cascade reveal - actions stack downward/upward from FAB
    3. Context menu overlay - actions appear near FAB on click
  - **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation between actions, ESC to close
  - **Design Inspiration:** Facebook Messenger, Gmail mobile FAB patterns
  - **Estimated Impact:** Unified mobile control hub for blog interactions
  - **Priority:** Low (backlog, future enhancement)

- [ ] **Advanced Holographic Card Effects with Mouse Tracking** (4-6 hours)
  - **Current Status:** Disabled pending implementation
  - **Scope:** Refactor card hover effects with dynamic mouse tracking
  - **Reference Patterns:** 
    - Vercel dashboard card interactions (magnetic borders, gradient borders)
    - Framer Motion parallax effects
    - Real-time cursor position tracking
    - Dynamic 3D tilt based on mouse location
  - **Implementation Plan:**
    1. Mouse event tracking hook (`useMouseTracker`) - tracks cursor position relative to card
    2. Dynamic border shine effect - follows cursor movement
    3. Gradient border animation - CSS mask or border-image with gradient
    4. Card tilt/perspective - 3D rotation based on cursor X/Y
    5. Parallax image shift - subtle image movement paralleling mouse
    6. Performance optimization - throttle tracking, GPU acceleration via `will-change`
    7. Mobile fallback - disable tracking on touch devices, use static effects
    8. Accessibility - respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for all animations
  - **Files to Update:**
    - `src/components/home/featured-post-hero.tsx` - re-enable holo effects
    - `src/components/blog/post/post-list.tsx` - all layout variants (magazine, grid, list, compact)
    - `src/styles/holo-card.css` - add new selectors for dynamic border tracking
    - Create new: `src/hooks/useMouseTracker.ts` - cursor tracking utility
    - Create new: `src/lib/card-tilt.ts` - 3D tilt calculations
  - **Design Inspiration:**
    - Vercel's featured blog cards with animated borders
    - Apple's product pages with parallax depth
    - Tailwind UI premium components with shimmer effects
  - **Estimated Impact:** Significant visual polish, competitive feature parity with modern platforms
