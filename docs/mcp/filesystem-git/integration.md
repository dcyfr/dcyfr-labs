## Configuration

### MCP Configuration File
**Location**: `mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/path/to/cyberdrew-dev"
      ],
      "disabled": false
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-git",
        "/path/to/cyberdrew-dev"
      ],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Guide

### Filesystem MCP

#### Key Capabilities
- **List directories**: Browse project structure safely
- **Read files**: Access file contents with permission checking
- **Write files**: Create and modify files safely
- **Move/rename**: Refactor file structure
- **Delete**: Remove files with safety checks
- **Search**: Find files by pattern

#### Example Use Cases

**1. Project Navigation**
```
"Show me the structure of the components directory"
→ Filesystem MCP lists all components and subdirectories
```

**2. Finding Code Patterns**
```
"Find all TypeScript files using the 'Button' component"
→ Filesystem MCP searches and identifies files
```

**3. Bulk Refactoring**
```
"Rename all instances of 'theme.tsx' to 'theme-provider.tsx'"
→ Filesystem MCP handles file operations safely
```

**4. Directory Analysis**
```
"What files are in src/components/ui?"
→ Filesystem MCP provides complete listing with metadata
```

### Git MCP

#### Key Capabilities
- **Log analysis**: View commit history
- **Diff analysis**: Compare commits and branches
- **Branch operations**: Create, switch, delete branches
- **Status checking**: View repository status
- **Blame**: Find who changed what and when
- **Show commits**: View full commit details

#### Example Use Cases

**1. Commit History Analysis**
```
"Show recent commits related to security changes"
→ Git MCP analyzes log and filters relevant commits
```

**2. Change Understanding**
```
"What changed between the main branch and current branch?"
→ Git MCP performs diff analysis
```

**3. Branch Comparison**
```
"Compare the CSP implementation between branches"
→ Git MCP shows differences between branches
```

**4. Documentation Generation**
```
"Generate a changelog from commits in the last week"
→ Git MCP gathers commit information for changelog
```

**5. Problem Investigation**
```
"When was this function added and why?"
→ Git MCP uses blame and show to find answers
```

## Integration with Existing MCPs

### Combined Workflows

#### Filesystem + Git for Feature Development
1. **Git MCP** checks branch status and commit history
2. **Filesystem MCP** navigates to relevant files
3. **Sequential Thinking** MCP plans changes
4. **Memory** MCP tracks decisions and context

#### Filesystem + Context7 for Refactoring
1. **Filesystem MCP** finds all files using a pattern
2. **Context7** MCP fetches library documentation
3. **Sequential Thinking** plans refactoring strategy
4. **Filesystem MCP** applies changes safely

#### Git for Code Review
1. **Git MCP** shows diff between commits
2. **Sequential Thinking** analyzes changes
3. **Filesystem MCP** examines related files
4. **Memory** tracks review findings

## Security Considerations

### Filesystem MCP
✅ **Safe Operations**:
- Permission validation before file operations
- Path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Respects `.gitignore` patterns
- Can exclude sensitive directories

✅ **Configuration**:
- Limited to project root directory
- Cannot access files outside project
- All operations logged and auditable

### Git MCP
✅ **Safe Operations**:
- Read-only for most operations by default
- No credential exposure in logs
- Works with git's own security model
- Respects `.gitignore` for visibility

✅ **Environment**:
- Uses local git repository
- No external API calls
- Credentials managed by git
- Can use SSH keys securely

## Practical Examples

### Use Case 1: Understanding a Recent Change
```
User: "What changed in the rate limiting implementation recently?"

Git MCP → Shows recent commits touching rate-limit.ts
Filesystem MCP → Displays current rate-limit.ts
Sequential Thinking → Explains the changes
```

### Use Case 2: Component Refactoring
```
User: "Find all uses of the old Button component and show me the new version"

Filesystem MCP → Searches for Button imports
Filesystem MCP → Shows old and new Button implementations
Sequential Thinking → Plans migration strategy
Filesystem MCP → Updates files safely
```

### Use Case 3: Deployment Preparation
```
User: "Show me all uncommitted changes and give me a summary"

Git MCP → Shows git status and diff
Sequential Thinking → Summarizes changes
Memory → Tracks what's ready to commit
```

### Use Case 4: Documentation Updates
```
User: "What API routes were added in the last commit?"

Git MCP → Shows last commit details
Filesystem MCP → Lists new files in src/app/api
Sequential Thinking → Identifies changes needing documentation
```

## Best Practices

### Filesystem MCP
1. **Always verify paths** before bulk operations
2. **Use search before edit** to confirm all files
3. **Keep backups** of important files (git helps!)
4. **Review diffs** before confirming changes
5. **Test changes locally** after filesystem operations

### Git MCP
1. **Check status** before making assumptions
2. **Review diffs** before committing
3. **Use branches** for experimental changes
4. **Document commit messages** clearly
5. **Push frequently** to backup changes

### Combined Usage
1. **Understand before acting**: Use Git + Filesystem to understand current state
2. **Plan changes**: Use Sequential Thinking to plan modifications
3. **Track decisions**: Use Memory to remember context
4. **Verify results**: Use Git to confirm changes match intent
5. **Document**: Use all MCPs together for comprehensive documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Filesystem MCP Not Working
**Problem**: "Cannot access file system"
- ✅ Verify mcp.json configuration
- ✅ Check file permissions
- ✅ Ensure path in mcp.json is correct
- ✅ Check if files are in .gitignore

### Git MCP Not Working
**Problem**: "Cannot access git repository"
- ✅ Ensure you're in a git repository
- ✅ Verify git is installed and in PATH
- ✅ Check SSH key setup if using SSH
- ✅ Verify repository is accessible

### Permission Issues
**Problem**: "Permission denied" errors
- ✅ Check file permissions with `ls -la`
- ✅ Ensure user has read/write access
- ✅ Check directory ownership
- ✅ Try with `chmod` if needed
