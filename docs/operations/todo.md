## 📋 Quick Reference

### Getting Started

1. **Phase 1 & 2 Complete** ✅ - Foundation and performance work done
2. **Phase 3: Enhancement Mode** - Focus on data-driven improvements
3. **One enhancement at a time** - Validate with analytics before next item
4. **Content creation priority** - Work through editorial calendar
5. **Update done.md** - Move completed items with date and learnings

### Priority Decision Framework
Ask these questions before adding new items:

1. **Is it critical?** (compliance, security, accessibility) → 🚨 CRITICAL
2. **Does it prevent problems?** (monitoring, backups, testing) → 🔴 HIGH  
3. **Does it drive growth?** (SEO, performance, content) → 🟡 MEDIUM
4. **Is it data-validated?** (analytics show user need) → 🟢 LOW
5. **Is it speculative?** (no user request, no data) → ⚪ BACKLOG or REMOVE

### Before Starting Work
- [ ] Check accessibility impact (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Estimate effort realistically (add 25% buffer)
- [ ] Consider test coverage needs
- [ ] Plan documentation updates
- [ ] Review related components/systems

### Before Committing
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and fix errors
- [ ] Test with `npm run build` (catches type errors)
- [ ] Update blog post `updatedAt` for content changes
- [ ] Test in multiple browsers if UI changes
- [ ] Review Lighthouse scores for major UI changes
- [ ] Update documentation if behavior changes
- [ ] Move completed item to `done.md` with date

### Effort Estimates
- **30 min - 2 hours**: Quick wins, config changes, simple components
- **3-6 hours**: New features, API integrations, moderate refactoring  
- **8-12 hours**: Complex features, testing infrastructure, large refactors
- **2+ weeks**: Major projects - break down into smaller milestones

### ROI Indicators
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Must do** - High impact, prevents problems, saves time
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Should do** - Clear value, improves key metrics
- ⭐⭐⭐ **Nice to have** - Positive impact but not urgent
- ⭐⭐ **Low priority** - Marginal benefit, do when time permits
- ⭐ **Questionable** - Consider removing or deferring
